0," Shares of cannabis companies Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY) , Cronos Group (NASDAQ: CRON) , and New Age Beverages (NASDAQ: NBEV)  dropped 19.4%, 14.8%, and 10.4%, respectively, in March, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . For context, the S&P 500 rose 1.9% last month. Those stocks have continued to struggle this month: through April 4,  Tilray has fallen another 6.8%, Cronos edged down by almost 1%, and New Age lost 5.7%. The S&P 500 gained 2.3% over the period. Tilray and Cronos are major Canadian marijuana growers, while New Age Beverages is a Denver- and Utah-based maker of coffees and teas, energy drinks, and other functional beverages. Last October, it entered the cannabidiol-infused beverage market. (CBD is a nonpsychoactive chemical found in the cannabis plant that is purported to have various medicinal benefits.)  Image source: Getty Images. We can attribute the trio's subpar March performances in part due to weakness in the sector. In general, cannabis stocks had a strong start to 2019 (Tilray is one notable exception), so pullbacks in the group weren't unexpected. Moreover, last month, many of the players released quarterly results that didn't excite investors, which contributed to the negative sentiment surrounding the sector.  Data by YCharts. On March 8, Jefferies initiated coverage of Tilray stock with an underperform rating. While investors shouldn't pay too much attention to the Street's stock ratings, changes in them can move prices. Tilray stock didn't head lower immediately in reaction to the Jefferies analyst's opinion, but the firm's action could have been one factor negatively affecting the share price later in the month. On March 18, the Canadian cannabis grower released its fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 results. Shares fell 3.4% the next day, as investors apparently were somewhat underwhelmed. In Q4, as my colleague Keith Speights detailed , revenue soared 204% to $15.5 million, driven by the opening of the Canadian recreational market in October. While this metric easily beat the $14.2 million Wall Street consensus estimate, on the bottom line, the company fell short of expectations. Tilray reported a quarterly net loss of $31 million, or $0.33 per share. That compared poorly to its net loss of $3 million, or $0.04 per share, in Q4 2017, and was much worse than the $0.12 per share loss that analysts had been expecting. On March 26, Cronos released its Q4 and full-year 2018 results -- and the market was not pleased, pushing shares down by 9.9% at the close. For the quarter , net revenue landed at 5.6 million Canadian dollars, a 248% year-over-year increase, but well short of the CA$7 million that analysts had been looking for. The company also posted a quarterly loss of CA$11.8 million, compared to a profit of CA$667,000 a year earlier. Moreover, Cronos stock racked up two Wall Street downgrades last month. On March 11, BMO Capital lowered its rating on the stock to underperform from perform. Then on the 27th, Canaccord Genuity downgraded it to a sell from a hold. There were no notable announcements about New Age Beverages last month that could be deemed catalysts for its share price decline. In fact, the only significant news from the company was the March 29 release of its Q4 and full-year 2018 reports -- and the market apparently was at least satisfied with the numbers, as shares rose 2% on the news. In the quarter, the company's net revenue increased 24% to $14 million, while its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss doubled to $4.5 million, driven in part by costs associated with its $85 million acquisition of Morinda Holdings, which closed in December. This deal made New Age a much bigger company, and transformed it into an international player, as Morinda has operations in 60 countries. It seems likely that New Age stock's pullback last month was a continuation of the profit-taking that began in February , during which the stock declined more than 17%, following its 36.7% run-up in January  and 140% gain last year. Some investors could be jittery about increased competition in the CBD market, due to the passage of the U.S. Farm Bill, which became effective on Jan. 1. One section of that legislation made it legal to grow and process industrial hemp in all 50 U.S. states. CBD can be extracted from both hemp and marijuana. Despite March's pullbacks, Cronos stock is still having a great 2019, though shares of Tilray and New Age Beverages are down by low-double-digit and mid-single-digit percentages, respectively. We can largely attribute Cronos' robust performance to investor enthusiasm about the company's partnership with tobacco giant Altria (NYSE: MO) . In early December, the two companies announced that Altria would buy a 45% stake in Cronos for approximately $1.8 billion (about 2.4 billion Canadian dollars). That purchase closed early last month.  Data by YCharts . By default, this chart includes after-hours trading on April 4. In recent years, investors didn't need to be too careful about choosing a cannabis stock, as the growing legal cannabis market and investor enthusiasm about its future propelled many of the group's stocks higher. This rising-tide-lifts-nearly-all-boats dynamic is likely to change soon -- and perhaps this year -- as the players become more differentiated. So smart stock-picking should become more important. Remember, the cannabis stock space is volatile and risky. Don't invest more money in these stocks than you can afford to lose.  10 stocks we like better than Cronos Group Inc.

1," April 5 (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value LP said on Friday it was withdrawing its nominations for directors at Dollar Tree Inc's board, saying that it was pleased with the company's decision to test multiple price points at its stores. Starboard in January pushed for changes at the discount chain, seeking to capitalize on criticism from some investors and analysts that Dollar Tree should consider raising prices for some products to more than $1. The hedge fund, along with its director nominations, had urged Dollar Tree to explore all alternatives for its Family Dollar business, including a sale. ""We continue to enjoy constructive conversations with management and recognize their progress, as well as the significant increase in shareholder value based on the promises made since our involvement,"" Starboard said.

2," April 5 (Reuters) - Representatives of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido have asked a U.S. court to overturn a prior ruling allowing Canadian miner Crystallex to seize part of U.S. refiner Citgo, which is owned by state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela. Guaido heads the opposition-controlled National Assembly and in January invoked the country's constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing President Nicolas Maduro's 2018 re-election was a fraud. The United States and most Western countries have recognized him as the country's rightful leader. Last year, a judge ruled Crystallex could seize shares in Citgo and auction them in its bid to get paid on a $1.4 billion award tied to the 2008 nationalization of its gold mining operations by the now cash-strapped South American country. ""Such an auction would not just be unseemly; it would be dangerous, undermining U.S. foreign policy by impeding President Guaido's ability to complete the transition of the Republic to democracy,"" the attorneys with Washington law firm Arnold & Porter wrote in a brief dated April 3. Guaido named a board of directors to Citgo in February, a move he described as ""protecting our assets."" Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled Guaido's representatives could request a stay, and gave them until this week to present their arguments. Maduro, a socialist who says he is the victim of an attempted U.S.-led coup, has accused the opposition of trying to ""steal"" Citgo. In its March 20 ruling allowing Guaido's representatives to intervene in the case, the judge said Crystallex would have until April 10 to respond to its arguments. ",-29.109999999999673,0
3," Delta Air Lines DAL has seen its stock price soar 16% over the last month, driven by updated first-quarter earnings and revenue guidance that helped show Wall Street that some of its recent business traveler-focused investments have started to pay off. With that said, let's take a look at exactly what to expect from Delta's Q1 earnings results Wednesday. Overview Delta saw its stock price surge on Tuesday after the company upped its quarterly earnings and revenue guidance. The company also announced that it renewed its partnership with American Express AXP for its Delta credit cards, which is set to run through 2029. And, in a sign that executives might think DAL stock is undervalued, the country's third-largest carrier by traffic completed $1.3 billion in share repurchases during the quarter. Amid increased competition among U.S. airlines, Delta has spent heavily to attract business customers. The moves include new lie-flat seats and higher-end facilities at airports. The Atlanta-based firm clearly looks strong heading into Q1 earnings season. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines LUV recently cut its quarterly unit-revenue forecast, citing unplanned maintenance and weather-based flight cancellations. Southwest also pointed to the grounding of its Boeing BA 737 MAX fleet as a reason for its subdued guidance ( What to Expect from Boeing's Q1 Earnings Amid 737 MAX Headwinds ).    Outlook & Earnings Trends Moving on, Delta's first quarter 2019 revenue is projected to pop 4.2% to reach $10.39 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. This would mark a bit of a slowdown from Q4's roughly 5% top-line growth, which did fall just short of our quarterly estimate for the second time during the last four quarters. At the bottom of the income statement, DAL's adjusted Q1 earnings are expected to surge 17.6% to reach $0.87 per share. Peeking further ahead, the company's full-year EPS figure is projected to climb 16.5%. We should also note that the company topped our earnings estimate last quarter, as it has for the trailing four periods. Plus, the chart below shows how much more positive Delta's earnings estimate revisions have turned over the last seven days, propelled by its updated quarterly guidance.    Bottom Line Delta is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) based for the most part on its earnings estimate revision activity. The firm also sports ""A"" grades for Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Shares of DAL closed regular trading Friday up 0.89% to $57.73 per share. Delta is scheduled to report its first quarter 2019 financial results before the opening bell on Wednesday, April 10. So, make sure to head back to Zacks for a full breakdown of the company's actual quarterly metrics. Investors interested in the airline industry should also be on the lookout for reports from United Airlines UAL , Southwest, JetBlue JBLU , and others due out in the coming weeks.

4," By Phil Stewart, Lesley Wroughton and Steve Holland WASHINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - The United States is expected to designate Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps a foreign terrorist organization, three U.S. officials told Reuters, marking the first time Washington has formally labeled another country's military a terrorist group. The decision, which critics warn could open U.S. military and intelligence officials to similar actions by unfriendly governments abroad, is expected to be announced by the U.S. State Department, perhaps as early as Monday, the officials said. It has been rumored for years. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a strident Iran hawk, has advocated for the change in U.S. policy as part of the Trump administration's tough posture toward Tehran. The announcement would come ahead of the first anniversary of President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran and to reimpose sanctions that had crippled Iran's economy. The administration's decision to make the designation was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The United States has already blacklisted dozens of entities and people for affiliations with the IRGC, but the organization as a whole is not. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury designated the IRGC's Quds Force, its unit in charge of operations abroad, ""for its support of terrorism,"" and has described it as Iran's ""primary arm for executing its policy of supporting terrorist and insurgent groups."" Iran has warned of a ""crushing"" response should the United States go ahead with the designation. IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari warned in 2017 that if Trump went ahead with the move ""then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world."" Such threats are particularly ominous for U.S. forces in places such as Iraq, where Iran-aligned Shi'ite militia are located in close proximity to U.S. troops. Republican Senator Ben Sasse said the move would be an important step in America's maximum pressure campaign against Tehran. ""A formal designation and its consequences may be new, but these IRGC butchers have been terrorists for a long time,"" Sasse said in a statement. Former Under-Secretary of State and lead Iran negotiator, Wendy Sherman, said she worried about implications for U.S. forces. ""One might even suggest, since it's hard to see why this is in our interest, if the president isn't looking for a basis for a conflict,"" said Sherman, who is director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""The IRGC is already fully sanctioned and this escalation absolutely endangers our troops in the region.""  IRGC'S REACH Set up after the 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system, the IRGC is Iran's most powerful security organization. It has control over large sectors of the Iranian economy and has a huge influence in its political system. The IRGC is in charge of Iran's ballistic missiles and nuclear programs. Tehran has warned that it has missiles with a range of up to 2,000 km (1,242 miles), putting Israel and U.S. military bases in the region within reach. The IRGC has an estimated 125,000-strong military with army, navy and air units and answers to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It is unclear what impact the U.S. designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization might have on America's activities in countries that have ties with Tehran, including in Iraq. Baghdad has deep cultural and economic ties with Iran and Oman, where the United States recently clinched a strategic ports deal. ",-29.109999999999673,0
5," Shares of Carnival Corporation (NYSE: CCL)  slipped last month after the cruise-line operator turned in a disappointing first-quarter earnings report and slashed its full-year guidance. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence , the stock finished March down 12%. As you can see from the chart below, the bulk of the stock's losses came when its earnings report came out at the end of the month.  CCL data by YCharts. Carnival, which owns a number of other cruise lines including Princess and Holland America, saw strong demand in the first quarter, but costs also rose, which turned off investors.  Image source: Carnival. Overall revenue rose 10.4%, to $4.67 billion, driven by a sharp increase in onboard spending, and topped estimates at $4.31 billion. However, costs rose faster than revenue, and operating income fell from $419 million to $386 million. Adjusted earnings per share slipped from $0.52 to $0.49, but that still beat muted expectations of $0.44. Gross revenue yields, measured by revenue per available lower-berth day, increased by 0.5% in constant currency, better than guidance for flat growth. However, costs increased 0.9% excluding fuel. CEO Arnold Donald said, ""First-quarter earnings included revenue growth from higher capacity and improved onboard spending, offset by the timing of cost increases and a drag from fuel price and currency compared to the prior year."" Due, in part, to rising fuel prices and a stronger dollar, Carnival slashed its full-year earnings guidance. On the top line, it continued to call for a 1% increase in yields but dialed down profit expectations from $4.50-$4.80 to $4.35-$4.55, which still represents growth from $4.26 a year ago. While currencies always fluctuate, Carnival investors may have to get used to rising fuel prices as oil prices have been low for some time. Though growth looks muted for the foreseeable future, investors can take advantage of the 3.8% dividend yield for now.  10 stocks we like better than Carnival

6," By Collin Eaton HOUSTON, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Friday stepped up efforts to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from office by imposing new sanctions on its oil shipments, and promising ""stronger action"" against Cuba for helping to keep the regime afloat. Greater efforts to prevent oil revenues from reaching Maduro, including sanctions on Venezuela's finance and oil sectors, were coming, Pence said in Houston before a hand-picked audience of 300 people, many from the local Venezuelan community who support Maduro's ouster. The United States and leaders of most nations in the Western Hemisphere consider Maduro's 2018 reelection illegitimate and have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the company's interim president. Maduro dismisses Guaido as a U.S. puppet. After Pence's speech, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA that carry oil to customers outside the region. It also sanctioned two shipping operators and a vessel that delivered oil to Cuba in February and March. Pence bashed the island nation's leaders as the ""real imperialists"" in the Western Hemisphere, adding: ""The time has come to liberate Venezuela from Cuba."" An estimated 50,000 Venezuelans, the second-largest expatriate community outside of south Florida, live in Houston. Many of them support U.S. efforts to rid Venezuela of Maduro, having fled the socialist politics of former leader Hugo Chavez for a home in Houston's energy industry. However, some Venezuelan expatriates in Houston believe tougher actions than Pence's proposals on Friday were needed to replace the government. ""It's going to take more than economic sanctions,"" said Andres Carvallo, a former Venezuelan lawyer and journalist who attended the speech. In addition to sanctions, the United States should organize a military coalition of countries to remove the current government, he said. Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan native and Latin American energy expert at Rice, said many expatriates had hoped that Pence would deliver a plan to get the Venezuelan military to stop supporting Maduro. ""It doesn't seem the military is willing to remove support from Maduro,"" which has proven more difficult than opposition leaders had expected. ""We want to see more than barking. We want to see action,"" said Miguel Eljuri, a Venezuelan living in Houston who also once worked for PDVSA. Maria Gonzalez, an economist who listened to the speech, welcomed tougher action, adding her mother in Venezuela lacks water, power and basic supplies. As for the Trump administration's reversal of the U.S. opening to Cuba, she said: ""they do not deserve our help."" ",-29.109999999999673,0
7," The tax reform laws enacted in late 2017 have finally been put to the test, and most taxpayers have either already seen or have a good idea of what impact they'll have on their individual tax returns. Yet among all the changes that tax reform brought about, lawmakers continue to wrangle with one part of the legislation: the $10,000 limitation on itemized deductions for state and local taxes. But even though lawmakers in high-tax states continue to fight for further changes to the new limitation, there's an aspect of the debate that has largely gone unnoticed. Even though the new limit has indeed caused millions of taxpayers to claim less in itemized deductions than they did under previous law, other tax law changes affecting the alternative minimum tax will be a substantial offset -- and recent research suggests that in many cases, even those subject to the SALT deduction limitation are reaping net savings from the tax law changes.  Image source: Getty Images. Financial analysts at Bloomberg recently released their analysis of tax returns in past years to see what net impact the SALT deduction limits would have on taxpayers. The research found that about three-quarters of those who paid more than $10,000 in state and local taxes annually -- and therefore would likely be subject to the new limits for 2018 -- also had to pay alternative minimum tax. That might not seem like a related issue, but it's important because of the way that alternative minimum tax gets calculated. Unlike the regular tax laws, the rules for the AMT have never allowed taxpayers to deduct any of their state and local tax liability. At the time that the AMT came into existence in the early 1980s, deductions like the SALT provisions played a vital role for many wealthy taxpayers in minimizing overall tax, and lawmakers wanted to take efforts to ensure that no matter how many tax breaks people qualified to take, they would still have to pay at least some minimum amount of tax on their income. At one point during the fight for tax reform, Congress looked seriously at fully repealing the AMT . Cost concerns about the overall tax law package made that impractical, but what instead got passed was a more complicated set of new rules that largely achieved the same end goal. First, the new laws dramatically boosted the exemption amounts under the AMT, making fewer people have to worry about the tax at all. More important for wealthier taxpayers was the change to the income limits at which that exemption amount started to phase out. Under previous law, exemptions started to disappear at income levels as low as around $120,000 for single filers and $160,000 for joint filers. Now, no phaseout occurs until income reaches $500,000 or $1 million for single and joint filers, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of these changes, only about 200,000 taxpayers are likely to pay AMT for the 2018 tax year. That's down from more than 5 million who were typically subject to the tax under previous law. Bloomberg's way of casting the problem is reasonable, but it is subject to one criticism: Just because someone was subject to the AMT doesn't mean that they got no benefit from state and local tax deductions. It's true that for AMT purposes, no deduction for state and local tax payments was allowed. But the way the AMT works involves comparing liability under its alternate tax scheme with tax liability under the regular tax rules. Taxpayers end up paying whichever tax is greater. So, if you take away a deduction in the regular tax rules, it can push your regular tax liability above what you owe under the AMT rules, boosting your total tax bill. In effect, you do get a deduction for state and local taxes -- even if you were subject to the AMT. It's unclear from the analysis how many of those former AMT-paying taxpayers are in that category. But what is clear is that every individual situation is different, and what affects one taxpayer favorably might hit another one's taxes unfavorably. Those in high-tax states will continue to fight against the SALT deduction limits, because under the new AMT rules, they have even more to gain from any upward allowance in their itemized deductions. But behind the scenes, you should keep in mind that many of those making these arguments have already seen big benefits from tax reform's other provisions.

8,"Overall, what struck me this week were the effects of inflation and population. Except for a few data points, the releases from the government agencies showing monetary values are not inflation-adjusted or population-adjusted to determine real growth:  Generally, this means that for REAL growth, the monetary data point must exceed 2.5% year-over-year for there to be real economic growth.

9," When Americans think of car sales, automakers like General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford usually come to mind, as do scenes of parking lots filled with shiny vehicles at local dealerships. However, most consumers would be surprised to learn that Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) is one of the biggest car dealers in the country. Last year the Costco Auto Program sold more than 650,000 vehicles, accounting for nearly 4% of the estimated 17.7 million vehicles sold in the U.S. last year. Even more impressive is that Costco's vehicle sales rose more than 25% from the year before, compared to just a 0.6% increase for the overall industry. In a three-month holiday sales event with GM at the end of the year, auto sales rose 22%.  Image source: Costco. Costco doesn't actually sell vehicles directly. Instead, it acts as a negotiator for its members, offering low, fixed prices on a wide range of vehicles from local dealerships. Costco members simply enter their zip code and see a list of available vehicles selling for below the standard MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price). The fixed prices, which save Costco members on average more than $1,000, seem to be the biggest selling point of the program, as they allow shoppers to avoid the usual hassle of haggling over prices and dealing upselling. It also gives them the peace of mind of knowing they got a good deal, as Costco has significantly more leverage than the average customer. Costco's auto program is just one of many perks to being a member of the warehouse club. Though shopping at its bargain-priced warehouses is the most obvious one, Costco members also get benefits like discounts on vacation packages, cruises, and hotels, and savings on items outside the usual retail fare like gasoline, optical, and auto parts like tires. In many ways, the list of wide-ranging benefits resembles Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime -- though a Costco membership is cheaper -- and that model may explain why both companies continue to take market share from other retailers. Costco doesn't make any money from the Auto Program. Rather, it uses the service to attract members and retain existing ones, much like Amazon does with add-on Prime perks like video streaming. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos once explained that model, saying, ""When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes."" If a new member joins Costco to get a deal on a new car, they're likely to start shopping at the warehouse club, adding to Costco's business. The popularity of Costco's Auto Program is self-evident, as sales have more than tripled in the last decade from just 200,000 vehicles sold in 2008, and the company is investing in it to keep up its strong growth, hiring more than 300 employees. The auto program is unique among retailers, and one of many examples of why Costco is beloved by members, as it almost always ranks near the top in customer satisfaction surveys.  The program also shows why Costco's business model is so hard to disrupt. Its membership base gives it a defense against competitors that most retailers don't have, and its renewal rates range around 90% because of perks like the auto program. If you save $1,000 on a new vehicle with Costco, you only need to buy one once a decade to make a membership worth it. With deals like that, it's clear that Costco won't be threatened by the ""retail apocalypse"" anytime soon. In fact, disrupting the auto market just looks like the latest step in making the company nearly invincible.  10 stocks we like better than Costco Wholesale

10," The fastest-growing companies can deliver knock-out returns for investors, but establishing a market presence or disrupting an existing industry can result in significant losses that can test an investor's patience. If you're willing to endure the inevitable volatility that comes from investing in aggressive growth stocks, now could be a great time to add Bandwidth (NASDAQ: BAND) , Alteryx (NYSE: AYX) , and Anaplan (NYSE: PLAN) to a long-term portfolio. Smart homes are allowing people to communicate in new ways, and that's providing a big tailwind for Bandwidth, a cloud-software company that's enabling voice communication on smart devices such as Google Home digital assistants and Alexa-enabled products.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. It's the only company providing communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) over its own, nationwide IP voice network, an advantage it believes allows it to provide better uptime, data analytics, and pricing than its competitors. Currently, its customer list includes 1,300 enterprises paying an average of $150,000 per year. In the future, growth can come from more penetration of existing relationships, winning new customers, and expanding internationally. Because the company has usage-based contracts, its revenue increases as its customers deploy more voice features in their products. It's also successfully cross-selling services. Its dollar-based retention rate was 118% in 2018, the highest in three years. Attracting new customers with its voice APIs, then expanding those relationships to messaging and 911 emergency-response APIs is paying off.

21," By Aaron Saldanha April 5 (Reuters) - An index of Latin American stocks rose to a more than two week closing peak on Friday, helped by solid gains in index heavyweights Brazil and Mexico, with broad risk sentiment buoyed by hopes of smoother U.S.-China trade. Brazilian Finance Minister Paulo Guedes said commitment to reforming the country's pension system across the political spectrum was solid, presenting an image of unity with some of the key congressional figures whose support he needs to pass the proposal. ""We were relatively busy for a Friday today,"" said Roger K. Horn, senior EM strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America, adding the government's pension reform proposal ""seemed to get a little more support today from leaders of Congress."" MSCI's index of Latin American stocks rose 1.3 percent, to post a weekly gain of 3.2 percent. Sao Paulo-traded stocks rose 0.8 percent, aided by strength across most sectors. State-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) saw its common shares and preferred shares rise 2.2 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. Along with higher oil prices, Petrobras shares were boosted by the news of its biggest ever divestment, with an Engie-led consortium offering $8.6 billion for 90 percent of gas pipeline unit TAG. Mexican stocks tacked on 2.4 percent on Friday, to finish the week 3.9 percent higher. Shares of America Movil SAB de CV surged 4.2 percent. JP Morgan upgraded the telecom firm's U.S.-listed stock to an ""Overweight"" rating and raised its price target to $17 from $16. The Mexican peso, one of the developing world's most liquid currencies, firmed 0.4 percent. The spread, or surplus yield, of local 10-year Mexican bonds over their U.S. peers saw its lowest level in about a week and a half, at just under 546 basis points. Argentina's stocks benchmark rose 1.6 percent, as it continued its recovery from Wednesday's 3.8 percent slide. The country's peso softened to a record closing low. The central bank cut the interest rate payable on short-term ""Leliq"" notes. ""Argentina was under pressure again with most bonds closing near the lows of the day,"" said SMBC Nikko's Horn. Colombia's peso firmed 0.2 percent, benefiting from a 1.4 percent rise in oil prices, while local stocks tacked on half a percent. The optimism broadly seen across the region did not support Chilean stocks, which fell half a percent. Chile's peso softened a touch, with a decline in the price of copper, the country's top export, in the backdrop.  Key Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 2056 GMT  ",-29.109999999999673,0
22," By Tatiana Bautzer and Gram Slattery SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO, April 5 (Reuters) - A consortium led by France'sEngie SA submitted the highest offer for a major gas pipeline unit owned by Brazil'sPetroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-run oil firm said on Friday, as the company's biggest divestment draws to a close. In a filing, Petrobras, as the company is known, said the Engie consortium, which includes Canada's Caisse de Dépôt e Placement du Québec, presented an $8.6 billion bid for 90 percent of the TAG gas pipeline unit in northern and northeastern Brazil. Two sources with knowledge of the matter said the difference between the bids was very small. The second highest bid, delivered by EIG Global Energy Partners and Mubadala Investment Company, was less than 1 percent below Engie's bid, they said. Engie subsidiaries in different countries account for 75 percent of the winning consortium and the Canadian pension fund the other 25 percent, one of the sources added, asking for anonymity to discuss undisclosed details. Around 60 percent of the bid was financed by Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Banco Bradesco SA and Banco do Brasil SA . The EIG-Mubadala group was financed by JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs. The third group, led by Brazilian holding Itausa Investimentos Itau SA, was also financed also by local banks. Banco Santander Brasil SA was Petrobras adviser on the deal. The price tag includes the payment by the Engie group of $800 million in debts to Brazilian state development bank BNDES. At an exchange rate of 3.85 reais to $1, Petrobras said, the deal values all of TAG at 35.1 billion reais. The divestment represents a victory for current Petrobras leadership and Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who is pushing to aggressively unload assets in a bid to cut debt and refocus on exploration and production. The sale process began in October 2017 but was interrupted last year by a Supreme Court injunction. In September 2016, Petrobras sold a larger gas network pipeline, Nova Transportadora do Sudeste, for $5.2 billion to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP, which beat out a bid by Engie. Petrobras will continue to distribute natural gas through the TAG system under the terms of long-term contracts, the company said in the statement. Bloomberg reported on the TAG sale earlier on Friday. ",-29.109999999999673,0

44," Cirrus Logic 's (NASDAQ: CRUS) stock recently tumbled after iFixit's teardown of Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) AirPods 2 revealed that the device didn't use Cirrus' new Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology. Instead, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss, who first spotted the exclusion, believes that Apple is using Maxim Integrated 's (NASDAQ: MXIM) competing codec, which processed audio for the original AirPods. Stoss believes that expectations for Apple to use Cirrus' ANC codec boosted the semiconductor supplier's stock price by more than 20% this year, and that its exclusion could cause the stock to sell off. Let's take a closer look at Cirrus' business to see if that fear is justified.  Image source: Apple. Cirrus Logic produces a wide range of audio chips and amplifiers. It generates most of its revenue from chips for portable audio products, including smartphones, and a lower percentage from non-portable audio devices and other devices. Cirrus' top customer is Apple, which accounted for a whopping 83% of its revenue last quarter. Cirrus supplies the audio chips for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Apple's robust hardware sales in previous years were a major tailwind for Cirrus. However, iPhone sales decelerated significantly last year, due to longer upgrade cycles, high prices, and tougher competition in high-growth markets like China. Demand for iPads peaked five years ago, and the soft PC market is throttling Mac sales. Apple is pivoting its core business toward subscription services to offset that decline, and it streamlines its supply chain in two ways to boost its margins. First, it's producing more of its own components -- including its A-series systems on a chip, Bluetooth chips for its AirPods, and security chips for storing biometric data. It's also developing its own GPUs, modems, and power management chips, and recen t report s indicate that it could replace Intel 's x86 CPUs with its own custom ARM chips in future Macs. Second, Apple often splits and shuffles orders of key components between two or more manufacturers. In previous iPhone models, it shuffled its chip manufacturing orders between Samsung and TSMC , and its modem orders between Intel and Qualcomm . Doing so arguably boosts Apple's clout in negotiations and reduces its dependence on individual partners and suppliers.  Image source: Apple. Apple's strategic shift raises red flags for Cirrus. Cirrus is Apple's longtime partner, but Apple could eventually produce its own audio codecs or split its orders with a competitor like Maxim. After all, Apple has abandoned partners before. When Apple decided to produce its own graphics chip, Imagination Technologies  lost about half its annual sales. Dialog Semiconductor (NASDAQOTH: DLGNF) , which previously sold power management chips to Apple, also sold its patents and a portion of its business to Apple when it realized that its top customer wanted to produce in-house power management chips. Dialog, which generated about three-quarters of its revenue from Apple, preferred to raise cash and diversify its business instead of suffering Imagination's fate. Apple's sluggish hardware sales will likely raise the priority of its efforts to build more components in-house. Apple's decision to use Maxim's codec again in the AirPods 2 might just be a matter of convenience, or it could be a dire warning sign. Cirrus often claims that it can diversify its core business away from Apple by selling more audio chips to Android original equipment manufacturers. Yet Apple's weight on Cirrus' top line fell only 3 percentage points annually to 83% last quarter, and no other customers accounted for over 10% of its revenue. At this point, it makes sense for Cirrus to diversify its business with investments or acquisitions. However, the company is mainly sitting still, waiting for the smartphone market to improve, and buying back shares. Cirrus repurchased $150 million in shares during the first three quarters of 2018 at an average price of $40.41, and added $200 million to its buyback program to boost its authorization to $250 million. It hasn't acquired any companies since 2015. Cirrus investors likely hoped that securing a spot in Apple's AirPods 2 could reduce its dependence on iPhones, iPads, and Macs and tighten its bond with the company. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that Apple's AirPods shipments will rise from about 27 million units last year to 100 million to 110 million units in 2021 -- so it could become a lucrative new revenue stream for Cirrus. But there's no guarantee that Cirrus won't suffer the fate of Imagination and Dialog as Apple vertically integrates its operations. Instead of focusing on content-share gains in other Apple products, Cirrus investors need to ask whether the company can survive without its biggest customer. If not, it might be wiser to simply buy shares of Apple instead.  10 stocks we like better than Cirrus Logic

45," When I was growing up, I remember the trips to the drive-through bank teller my mom would make every Friday. She'd deposit that week's paycheck and take out enough cash to last us the week. The only technological innovations about that trip: not having to get out of the car to wait in a long line inside, and the pneumatic tube that magically zipped my mom's driver's license and checks to the teller inside the bank. Without remembering how things used to be, it's easy to forget exactly how much technology has shaped the financial world. This intersection, where finances meet technological innovation, is called fintech, short for financial technology. The term is commonly used to describe how technology has made financial services cheaper, faster, and more convenient.  Fintech is making traditionally costly services cheaper, safer, and more convenient. Image source: Getty Images. Just a few years ago, at the dawn of online banking, it seemed revolutionary that you might never need to enter your bank's local branch to do your banking. You are now able to do almost all your banking from wherever you are, whenever you feel like it. This broad definition encompasses everything from mobile banking apps and direct deposit to P2P payments and AI-powered banking platforms . The 2017 Total System Services U.S. Consumer Payment Study shows many of the latest financial trends. Among other things, the study points out consumers' increasing levels of comfort with using a smartphone to manage their finances. According to the study, the following percentage of consumers are interested in using their phones for the following tasks: But that's not all. A sizable majority (63%) are now using banking apps, up from 46% in 2015. Two-thirds of consumers are familiar with in-app payments, and that percentage jumps to more than 80% for the respondents under the age of 34. With these trends taking off, it is easy to see why it might be advantageous to invest in this sector. The Global X Fintech Thematic ETF (NASDAQ: FINX) is an ETF dedicated to the fintech theme, and not surprisingly, it has trounced the S&P 500 index since its inception in late 2016. This is to be expected when some of its top holdings, such as Intuit , PayPal Holdings , and Square , have been some of the hottest stocks in the stock market over the past few years. This is probably the easiest way to invest in the sector, as it comes with instant diversification and and does not require intense study of individual companies.  FINX data by YCharts . The sector is risky because it is changing fast, with disruption and innovation coming from every direction. This translates into big banks offering new mobile offerings, complete with P2P payment and investing capabilities, while newer upstarts are offering legacy services such as personal loans and mortgages. Case in point: Fintech start-ups originated 38% of personal loans in 2018. This makes it hard to know which companies to invest in, even when the right trend is identified. In the table below that lists the best fintech stocks to buy now, you will find some that are suitable for every type of investor  -- from value to income to growth . Value and income investors will probably be more interested in financial legacy companies, such as big banks and insurance companies, experimenting with different technological offerings to improve their existing services. Growth investors will undoubtedly be attracted to the disruptors, the fintech start-ups that are shaking up the financial industry with innovative solutions to age-old pain points. These companies usually come with sky-high revenue growth rates and a valuation to match.  Let's take a closer look at each of these, counting down to what I think is the best fintech investment today, to see what they are doing to leverage technology in financial services and why they all might be stocks to buy. Goldman Sachs, founded in 1869, is one of America's largest and oldest banks. The financial institution has been able to replace many of its human traders with complex computer algorithms, some backed by machine learning and computer engineers. CFO Martin Chavez has said that the investment bank generally can replace four traders with one computer engineer. By early 2017, about one-third of Goldman's personnel, or approximately 9,000 employees, were computer engineers. Chavez said that most trades are now automated, even in opaque currency market s, where human trading was once thought to be essential.  Even some of the largest and oldest banks in the U.S., such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are investing heavily in technology to bring down costs, reduce risks, and explore ways to make banking more convenient. Image source: Getty Images. The change in the investment bank is obvious. It mapped out 146 distinct steps that needed to be taken in an IPO and discovered most could be automated. It launched a new platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs , which management said now offers three products to U.S. customers: consumer personal loans, savings accounts , and a personal finance app. Guidewire provides property and casualty (P&C) insurers with software platforms that allow them to run their businesses effectively. Guidewire's platforms enable insurance companies to accomplish seemingly all of their core services, from data analytics and digital engagement to underwriting and claims management. As of early 2019, Guidewire served more than 350 companies in 32 different countries, including Farmers Insurance and Nationwide. A quick glance at the company's recent results  might hide the real progress the company is making. While the headline numbers might appear lumpy, they hide the change taking place within the company as it transitions to subscription-based cloud platforms. In a conference call , CEO Marcus Ryu stated: While the results might not reflect the company's real growth for a while as the company makes its way through this transition, Guidewire should provide patient shareholders with superior long-term returns. SS&C Technologies provides software platforms to financial institutions, asset managers, and trusts that enable the manager to integrate their daily tasks, such as trading and portfolio management, with back-office functions, such as accounting and regulatory compliance. Most of these software platforms are subscription-based, requiring contract terms of one to five years and can come with maintenance support provided by SS&C for additional fees. While the company's results were distorted due to its $5.4 billion acquisition of DST Systems in 2018, the overall trend is undeniably positive . One of the most attractive characteristics of SS&C's business model is that it features a diversified client base of more than 12,000 customers, and 95% of its revenue is contractually recurring. Founded in 1999, Alibaba is a Chinese e-commerce juggernaut with its hands in a variety of technological services -- such as cloud computing offerings , an internet shopping search engine , and even the movie business  -- all beyond its core online marketplace platform. From 2015 to 2018, Alibaba's full-year revenue grew from $12.3 billion to almost $40.0 billion, good for a 225% increase. That's an eye-popping number for one of the world's largest companies. Even better, the company stated it expects to again grow revenue by at least 60% in its 2019 fiscal year. When the share price lags, it is primarily because its heavy investments in other ventures are dragging down its operating margin. One of these big investments that makes Alibaba especially attractive to fintech investors, however, is its 33% stake in Ant Financial, an extremely popular mobile payments platform in China and other parts of Asia. Ant Financial, formerly known as Alipay, serves 860 million active users through its core platform and joint ventures. In addition, it offers lending, cash management, and insurance to 15 million businesses. According to the company, whose large stake in Ant Financial it thinks is justified, ""We believe deepening our relationship through an equity stake in Ant Financial would bring key strategic benefits to us, including advancing our New Retail strategy with mobile payments, increasing user acquisition and retention through collaboration with the Alipay digital wallet, and enhancing the execution of our international expansion."" Industry experts say Ant Financial is currently preparing for an IPO and current private investments give it a valuation between $100-150 billion. JPMorgan Chase is the second large bank to make the list. While it offers a diversified array of traditional financial services to consumers and businesses, it has also made a number of investments in the fintech sector. Last year, the bank acquired WePay for at least $220 million, stating in its press release that it wanted WePay to act ""as Chase's payments innovation incubator in Silicon Valley."" WePay is a payments ecosystem that allows platforms to integrate payment solutions, such as GoFundMe, one of WePay's largest customers. WePay is far from Chase's only investment in the fintech space. New software and computer capabilities have allowed it to eliminate countless man-hours from administrative and legal processes. In an earnings release, CEO Jamie Dimon talked about several of the bank's efforts, including its new all-mobile bank, Finn: Blackline is a cloud-based software platform that allows businesses to automate burdensome and tedious accounting tasks, such as reconciling financial data, in real time. These tasks traditionally take lots of man-hours and are only done at the end of each month or even quarter. Blackline's platform allows businesses with several product lines in different geographical markets to accumulate this data instantaneously, giving companies the confidence needed to make quicker strategic decisions all while dramatically reducing accounting and back-office costs.  Blackline's software platform takes many of headaches out of regulatory compliance in accounting practices for multinational corporations. Image source: Getty Images. The company's growth doesn't appear as if it will be slowing down anytime soon. As fellow Foolish contributor Brian Feroldi points out , from 2016 to 2018, Blackline's revenue more than doubled while its global customers increased by 65% -- that's some heady growth. Blackline's net revenue retention rate is consistently over 100%, meaning its existing customers from the previous year are spending more every year. This demonstrates that its customers, including Coca-Cola , Under Armour , and eBay , are finding value in its services and ways to spend more with Blackline each year. Q2 Holdings is a technology company that helps smaller banks and credit unions offer cloud-based platforms so their account holders can enjoy good experiences across all digital channels. These smaller banks often do not have the IT expertise or the necessary in-house resources to compete with the virtual offerings of bigger rivals. Q2 Open, an open application programming interface (API), allows banks and other fintech companies to create more customized applications on top of Q2's core platforms. CEO Matt Flake is passionate about Q2's mission of putting these local financial institutions on equal technological footing with the titans of the finance industry. In an interview with The Motley Fool, Flake said: Many might know Square as the credit card reader used by their local farmer's market or favorite food truck. Indeed, that's how the company started, offering payment processing services to smaller businesses that could not traditionally afford card acceptance services. But today, under CEO Jack Dorsey's leadership, the company is so much more. Square is a place where small businesses can go to meet nearly all their administrative needs. These include: These types of services give Square a sticky ecosystem and help Square sell its core payment processing service to more customers. PayPal, for all intents and purposes, was the world's first digital wallet. The service gained significant traction as eBay's early buyers and sellers sought a safe and fast way to make transactions. PayPal has more than 260 million active user accounts, meaning those customers now use their accounts more than three times per month. That user engagement  for the platform is the highest since the company was spun off from eBay. PayPal's real growth and innovation lies in the area of mobile commerce . Mobile payments represent more than 40% of PayPal's total payment volume. The primary driver of this incredible growth is PayPal's One Touch , the platform that allows users to register a device from which they make online transactions, such as a desktop or smartphone, and then forevermore be able to make payments from that device with just one touch. The platform is beloved by consumers and merchants alike. I can attest that the platform makes buying things online amazingly simple and easy, but I am far from its only fan. An incredible 91% of consumers gave One Touch a rating of very good or better in a 2018 comScore study. More than half of mobile consumers (52%) made more online purchases because PayPal was offered at checkout. And a third of customers said they would not make a purchase at all if PayPal were not offered as a checkout option. Merchants love PayPal because its successful sales conversion rate is much higher than competitor offerings. Sales conversion rate is defined as the percentage of customers who begin the checkout process that actually complete it. A problem that has plagued e-commerce retailers for quite some time is the number of customers who place something in a virtual shopping cart but end up abandoning the purchase before finalizing it. This can be due to a number of things, like the length of time it takes to enter the tedious information required for purchases, such as their name, billing and shipping addresses, credit card number, and other personal information. One Touch elegantly solves this problem.  Image source: PayPal Holdings. Even as major credit card companies develop a universal checkout standard that sounds like it will accomplish many of these same things, One Touch's momentum could be too great to stop. As of the end of 2018, PayPal managemen t report ed that One Touch had more than 120 million consumers and 10 million merchants registered on the platform. This selection might surprise some investors. After all, isn't Mastercard just a boring payments network, offering a virtual highway for your funds to travel as your money leaves your bank account to go to a retailer's account? While that highly profitable network is its core business, the company is doing several things to supplement this payment network with additional services that are innovating payments, making them more convenient and secure. While it obviously innovates from within, it has also made a series of smart acquisitions  that are beginning to differentiate Mastercard from the competition. These acquisitions include: The services these acquisitions offer Mastercard's clients are bundled with other supplemental features, such as loyalty program management, fraud detection programs, and data analytics, which are accounted for in Mastercard's ""other revenues"" segment. As of the end of 2018, these services represented almost $1 billion in quarterly revenue, and they were expected to grow faster than its core payment business segments. More than that, however, these services are helping Mastercard win new deals and deepen its relationship with its card-issuing clients. As those deals expire, these banks and other financial institutions will be less likely to leave Mastercard for a competitor. Technology is going to continue to infiltrate the financial sector, just as it has our entire economy. The ultimate winners are consumers, as services get cheaper, more secure, and more convenient. Given that fintech is a trend that will continue to rise as technological innovations pour into the market, I believe the 10 companies listed above are the best ways for investors to profit from this movement.  10 stocks we like better than Mastercard

46," A deal to have Disney (NYSE: DIS) take over AT&T 's (NYSE: T) 10% stake in streaming service Hulu makes sense for both parties. In fact, it seems almost inevitable. Here's why the deal is in the works and what it might mean for AT&T and -- perhaps more importantly -- Disney.  Image source: Getty Images. Hulu began as a joint venture aimed at competing with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) while providing a streaming home for content created by the studios owned by Hulu's founders, which included Disney. Hulu had certain advantages over Netflix, like the fact that subscribers could view episodes of shows from seasons in progress (Netflix tends to release whole seasons at once after they've completed the year's run). Until recently, three companies -- Disney, Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) , and Twenty-First Century Fox -- each had a 30% stake in Hulu, and one company -- WarnerMedia -- had the last 10%. Then WarnerMedia got gobbled up by AT&T, and Disney acquired the vast majority of Twenty-First Century Fox in a huge merger deal. So Hulu is now under majority control by Disney regardless of whether the Disney-AT&T deal under discussion goes through. Meanwhile, Netflix's original content strategy has taken the studio-streaming integration concept -- arguably pioneered by Hulu, since it was owned by content-producing studios -- to a whole new level. Netflix has been very aggressive about creating its own content in its own studios for its own streaming services, and other companies are following suit. As Netflix focuses more on its own studios, companies with studios are focusing on creating new streaming services, and those companies include Disney and AT&T. For AT&T, the decision to get out of Hulu might be a pretty easy one. AT&T wouldn't want to give the content that it owns through WarnerMedia to a streaming service that it has a mere 10% stake in. And it has a better option: its own planned WarnerMedia streaming service, which is slated to debut in 2019 .  If AT&T wants out, Disney seems like the only logical buyer since Comcast is starting a streaming service, too -- albeit a less ambitious one than its peers are working on -- and could be planning a Hulu exit strategy of its own, though CEO Steve Burke has said it is not.  It's easy to imagine Disney owning 100% of Hulu someday soon. Thanks to its purchase of Twenty-First Century Fox assets, Disney will control the future of Hulu. It makes sense that Disney would want to wholly own its streaming services, because that kind of integration between streaming services and studios allows for lower expenses and higher profits. But Disney's Twenty-First Century Fox deal was done largely to set the stage for a different streaming service, Disney+. With its combined catalog of Disney and Fox studio holdings, Disney has a lot of content to get Disney+ started off right. But the Fox-Disney deal has also effectively given Disney Hulu, and having two streaming services is not exactly efficient. It seems like Disney will want to push its biggest and best hits to Disney+, and it's not as if many other studios will be eager to help Disney shore up Hulu's content supply. But Disney seems determined to try to make the two work together, and it is trying to position Hulu as a service for adults, while Disney+ aims at a younger demographic. Whether that works out remains to be seen. Hulu does have a live TV streaming service, which Disney+ will apparently not; but that live TV streaming service has a relatively low number of subscribers. It's easy to see the logic for both parties here -- everyone wants to own the whole studio-to-home-streaming supply chain in order to keep their operations as efficient as possible. What will be interesting to see is how Disney juggles its extra streaming service. If Disney+ is a smash hit, balancing its portfolio may not matter. But if efficiency is the name of the game, it's fair to wonder how Disney might try to repurpose Hulu. At least Disney won't have to worry about anyone else using Hulu's infrastructure to compete with Disney+; Disney will be doing that to itself.

47," Stocks moved higher after a positive jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI)  and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  both closed up modestly. The energy sector surged as the price of crude oil rose almost 2% to above $63. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. As for individual stocks, Triumph Group (NYSE: TGI) jumped after the company hinted at a major restructuring move, and  Greenbrier (NYSE: GBX) reported earnings.  Image source: Getty Images. Shares of aerospace component maker Triumph Group went airborne, rising 12.3% after the company said it is ""exploring strategic alternatives"" for its aerospace structures unit, which accounted for 61% of sales last quarter. The move came a day after the stock jumped 11% on news it had won a contract from Boeing to supply parts for refueling drones for the Navy. Triumph didn't reveal any details about its plans, saying that there can be no assurance of a transaction or a strategic change, and that there is no timetable for the review of the business. The company also said it wouldn't comment further until the board has approved a specific course of action. Just that little whiff of potential change was enough to excite investors. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, aerospace structures recorded an operating loss of $152 million, enough to put Triumph in the red with a net loss of $122 million, or $2.46 per share. The potential move would be the latest of several  in the company's ongoing restructuring. Greenbrier reported results for what was a difficult quarter for the rail car manufacturer, but the bad news was already out thanks to a pre-release two weeks ago , and the stock slipped only 0.9%. Revenue in fiscal Q2 grew 4.7% to $659 million, bu t earnings per share came in at $0.08 compared with $1.91 in the period a year earlier. Greenbrier delivered 5,100 rail cars in the quarter, up 4.1% from last year, and took orders for 3,800, breaking a string of three quarters when orders exceeded deliveries. The company has a large backlog worth $2.7 billion. The disappointing profit result was due to $0.29 per share in costs that Greenbrier attributed to performance issues. Poor manufacturing execution in Europe, contract loss accruals, and facility closure costs in its repair business affected results, and the company said it expects to resolve the issues quickly. Greenbrier had said last quarter that it expects a strong second half, with two-thirds of deliveries and 80% o f earnings coming in the next two quarters. The company maintained its outlook for full-year revenue but lowered EPS guidance by $0.60 to $3.60-$3.80.  Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy now

48," Shares of Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR) plunged 34.8% lower in March of 2019, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . The regional telecommunications company surged 52% higher in February , thanks to a mixed earnings report, but that leap may have been an overreaction. Frontier's stock slid back down in March amid a nearly total radio silence.  Image source: Getty Images. The fourth-quarter report that lifted Frontier's shares came at the very end of February, setting the stock up for a difficult March. To be clear, tha t report wasn't exactly brilliant. Frontier collected $2.12 billion of top-line revenues versus Wall Street's $2.09 billion consensus estimate, which worked out to a 1.4% outperformance. On the bottom line, adjusted net losses of $0.06 per share were harsher than the expected $0.04 loss per share. The investor confidence that resulted from that business update simply didn't have staying power. February's fleeting surge didn't exactly make millionaires out of Frontier's long-term investors. It's a tiny blip on a dramatic downward spiral over the last three years, and dividend-adjusted share prices have now crashed 96% lower over that period:  FTR Total Return Price data by YCharts. As a small player in a rapidly changing industry, Frontier is losing phone and cable customers to cellphone providers and cord-cutting, respectively. The stock now trades at a mere 0.16 times book value , indicating that investors think they would reap much more value from this company if it shut down its operations, sold all its assets, and returned that cash to shareholders.

50," By Tracy Rucinski and Eric M. Johnson CHICAGO/SEATTLE, April 5 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Friday it plans to cut its monthly 737 aircraft production by nearly 20 percent in the wake of two deadly crashes, signaling it does not expect aviation authorities to allow the plane back in the air anytime soon. Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling aircraft were frozen after a global grounding of the narrowbody model following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10, killing all 157 people onboard. U.S. and airline officials said they now believe the plane could be grounded for at least two months, but an even longer grounding is a serious possibility. The crash in Ethiopia and the crash of a Lion Air plane in Indonesia last October that killed all 189 people on board have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday said the company now knows that a chain of events caused both disasters, with erroneous activation of so-called MCAS anti-stall software ""a common link"" between the two. Boeing said it would not reduce jobs at the new production rate and will work to minimize the financial impact. The company's board will establish a committee to review how the company designs and develops airplanes, Muilenburg said. The group will ""recommend improvements to our policies and procedures"" for its 737 MAX and other airplane programs. Boeing said it continues to make progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent further accidents. Shares in Boeing Co fell around two percent after the market closed on Friday. While the number of 737 MAX planes grounded is just over 370, nearly 5,000 more are on order. Boeing faces logistical issues in finding places to park the growing number of planes as well as being responsible for all their maintenance costs since it has been unable to deliver the jets to customers, two people briefed on the situation said. Manufacturers avoid halting and then resuming production as this disrupts supply chains and can cause industrial snags. Boeing had been planning to speed up production in June to 57 a month. Having to hold planes in storage without delivering them does, however, consume extra cash through increased inventory. Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems Holdings said it will continue to make 52 737 MAX shipsets - the complete set of parts for each aircraft - per month, storing extras at its facilities. Its shares fell 3.5 percent. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that U.S. investigators were given the raw data from Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 as soon as it was read in France last month. He added that the Ethiopian Airlines 302 preliminary report ""was very thorough and well done."" Former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart was named by the Federal Aviation Administration this week to head an international team to review the safety of the 737 MAX. He told reporters on Friday he thought the review, which will start on Monday, could take about three months. It is still not clear what countries will take part. He said investigators are going to be focused far more on the interaction between software and pilots than mechanical issues in future. ""This is territory we are going to see more of,"" Hart said.

51," By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge reviewing an agreement between the government and CVS Health Corp allowing the pharmacy chain to buy health insurer Aetna indicated on Friday that he wanted to hold a hearing in May to hear from critics of the $69 billion deal. Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in a court hearing that he would likely take a week to hear from the American Medical Association and other opponents of the transaction, which closed in November. The Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a U.S. pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna in October on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc. Both deals have closed, and the government and companies have asked Leon to approve their consent decree. This is usually done with little fanfare but Leon has said in previous hearings that he was ""less convinced"" than the government that the asset sale resolved antitrust concerns. ""Health care is a very high priority for tens of millions of people,"" Leon said on Friday. ""This is a matter of great public interest."" Jay Owen, a lawyer for the Justice Department, urged the judge to consider avoiding further hearings, noting that the two sides as well as the deal's critics had filed their arguments with the court. ""The total record is adequate to make a ruling,"" said Owen. CVS attorney Enu Mainigi of the law firm Williams and Connolly LLP agreed, saying: ""I would urge the court to consider whether those witnesses are appropriate."" ",-29.109999999999673,0

53," Shares of Axos Financial (NYSE: AX) fell 10.3% in March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.  A combination of company-specific issues and broader concerns about the U.S. economy and how the Federal Reserve would react weighed heavily on the stock. Axos, which until last year was known as Bank of the Internet, disclosed in a March 8 regulatory filing  that its Axos Clearing unit had advanced $16.5 million to an unnamed correspondent customer to cover losses stemming from unauthorized securities trades by one of the client's employees. Axos Clearing holds $1.4 million of that customer's liquid assets to use as recovery, but the bank said it was uncertain it would receive repayment of the remaining $15.1 million.  Image source: Getty Images. Shares of the bank also traded down later in the month, along with other financial stocks, after the Federal Reserve took an unexpected dovish turn, throwing future rate hikes into doubt. The losses in bank stocks continued as 10-year Treasury bond yields fell below the yields on a 3-month Treasury, meaning the yield curve was inverted for the first time since 2007. Investors often view an inverted yield curve as a sign of economic trouble on the horizon. Axos had a great run, with shares doubling in value during a two-year period ending in June 2018, but the stock's performance since then has been dismal. Shares are down 30% since June. As the company has grown, it has faced some missteps that have confused investors , and the latest issue with its recently acquired clearing unit is likely to lead to more questions about whether Axos is growing too fast. The shares have recovered much of the March loss in the first week of April, trading up 6.8% so far this month. This is a company with an attractive cost profile relative to other financial institutions and big plans for expansion. It's up to management to prove to investors it can avoid unexpected stumbles as the business grows.  10 stocks we like better than Axos Financial, Inc.

54," ISTANBUL, April 5 (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that Turkey was continuing to make payments under its deal with Russia to buy S-400 missile defence systems and the United States had not presented the same terms when it offered to sell the rival Patriot missile system. ""The S-400 holds an important place in our talks. The United States' arguments are very wrong. We finished the S-400 process and our payments continue,"" Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul when asked about planned talks in Moscow next week. Turkey's planned purchase of the Russian system has put it at odds with NATO ally the United States. Earlier this week, Washington halted delivery to Turkey of equipment related to the stealth F-35 fighter aircraft because of the missile defence disagreement. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, suggested on Friday that a Turkish purchase of the Russian missile defense systems could present an opportunity for U.S. forces. ""It's shocking that Russia, however, isn't more worried about sending their equipment to a NATO nation, co-located with U.S. forces, where it can be studied and where we are likely to gain valuable intelligence,"" the official said.

57," Stocks generally moved up on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing to within about 1.5% of a new all-time closing high. Market participants are growing increasingly comfortable with the performance of the U.S. economy, especially in light of today's encouraging news on the jobs front. Yet some companies weren't able to share in the market's move higher. Duluth Holdings (NASDAQ: DLTH) , LivaNova (NASDAQ: LIVN) , and Boston Beer (NYSE: SAM) were among the worst performers. Here's why they did so poorly. Shares of Duluth Holdings plunged 25% after the clothing retailer reported its fourth-quarter financial results. Duluth said that revenue was higher by 15% than in the year-ago period, although the current year's quarter featured an extra week. However, net income rose only 7%, and full-year bottom-line figures were roughly flat, falling well short of expectations. Moreover, guidance for the coming fiscal year included projections for earnings growth of just 3% to 10%, and even with solid double-digit percentage sales growth likely, Duluth faces an uphill climb to overcome the challenges that CEO Stephanie Pugliese identified as affecting the retailer during the quarter.  Image source: Duluth Holdings. LivaNova's stock plummeted 28% following the medical technology company's release of preliminary revenue figures for the first quarter of 2019. LivaNova said that sales from continuing operations likely came in around $251 million, which was flat compared to year-earlier levels. The company cited unexpected weakness in the U.S. for its neuromodulation segment, while soft sales of its Perceval sutureless valve product hit LivaNova's cardiovascular business. After having had a tough end to 2018 , LivaNova is struggling to build some positive momentum. Finally, shares of Boston Beer fell 5.5%. The maker of the Sam Adams line of beer got negative comments from analysts at Goldman Sachs, who cut their rating on the company from neutral to sell. The main problem that analysts see ahead for Boston Beer is that there's been industrywide pressure on beer sales , and even though the company has done well to come out with new products outside the beer area, it'll be hard for Boston Beer to keep up that pace of innovation indefinitely. Unless conditions improve for its core Sam Adams products, Boston Beer could face tough times ahead.  Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy now

64," Shares of Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings (NASDAQ: CRBP) were soaring 11.4% higher as of 3:04 p.m. EDT on Friday. The nice gain came after Jefferies analyst Maury Raycroft initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and a one-year price target of $18, more than double the current share price for the drugmaker. Typically, Wall Street recommendations and price targets should be taken with a grain of salt. However, it's important for investors to understand why analysts are bullish about a stock. And Jefferies isn't the only investment firm that likes Corbus. Last month, Oppenheimer initiated coverage on the stock with an outperform rating and a price target that reflected a 300% gain at the level Corbus shares were trading at the time.  Image source: Getty Images. So why is there such excitement about Corbus? It centers on the prospects for the company's lead drug lenabasum, which is currently being evaluated in two late-stage studies. Corbus anticipates reporting the results from one of those studies focused on treating systemic sclerosis in the first half of 2020. It's possible that the company could submit lenabasum for FDA approval later next year if all goes well. That's not the only indication that Corbus is targeting with lenabasum. The company also has a phase 3 study underway evaluating the drug in treating dermatomyositis, as well as two phase 2 studies targeting cystic fibrosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Corbus is optimistic about the chances of success for lenabasum. CEO Yuval Cohen expressed his view in the company's fourth-quarter conference call that lenabasum could generate peak sales of up to $5 billion if it wins approvals in treating systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, and cystic fibrosis. Before Corbus can make the rosy price targets and revenue projections a reality, lenabasum has to first be successful in the clinical studies that are underway. It will be close to a year before we know if the drug is safe and effective in treating systemic sclerosis. Even longer waits will be required for the other targeted indications. In the meantime, it's likely that Corbus stock could be fairly volatile.  10 stocks we like better than Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings

65," Activist investors are finally ready to shake up the board of directors of Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY)  after five years and the loss of more than three quarters of its value. Three hedge funds declared they have had enough and want to wipe the slate clean by nominating 16 candidates to oust the entire 12-member board. The activists have watched the retailer's long, slow decline, but were unwilling to challenge the policies of the company's co-founders, who have been on the board for 48 years while allowing the changed retail landscape to pass them by. Now, these investors believe it's time for an entirely new board to take over. They say the home goods retailer needs a new direction.  Image source: Getty Images. Legion Partners Holdings, Macellum Advisors, and Ancora Advisors lay out a compelling case, starting with CEO Steven Temares. During his 16-year tenure, Bed Bath & Beyond has lost more than $8 billion in market value, while shareholder returns -- stock performance plus dividends -- has declined 58%. The company's stock has also fallen by more than 80% since early 2015. Even so, Temares and co-founders Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein have received over $300 million in compensation in that time frame. Moreover, when a majority of shareholders voted against reappointing director Victoria Morrison at last year's annual meeting, the three men and the board ignored investor wishes by unanimously voting to reject her letter of resignation. The hedge funds maintain that the Bed Bath & Beyond brand retains enormous value, but it can only be unlocked by getting rid of the existing insular and sclerotic board, and finding a new CEO. There's good evidence to back up their claims. Over the last five years, same-store sales have grown at an anemic compound annual rate of just 0.1% while gross margins have narrowed from 39% to 34%, a contraction of 520 basis points. At the same time, expenses have soared from 25% of revenue to 30%, while return on invested capital has plummeted from 25% to less than 10%. Bed Bath & Beyond has also pursued an acquisition strategy  of buying noncore businesses, including some owned by the co-founders' children, that the hedge funds say ""have failed to produce reasonable returns."" Furthermore, because the retailer is completely opaque about how any of these businesses perform, refusing to delineate any financial numbers on their operations other than the number of stores for each, investors are left in the dark about their true results.  BBBY EBITDA Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. What the board has done, however, is spend an enormous sum of money on buying back stock at progressively lower price points. According to the activist investors, Bed Bath & Beyond has spent nearly $8 billion since 2011 buying back stock at an average price of $59. Today, its shares trade at under $17, though they were trading below $15 before the investors announced their intention to supplant the board, indicating the market agrees it is time for the existing directors and management to go. The board didn't actually refute any of the points made by the hedge funds, instead saying that it is willing to listen to and work with all shareholders. It said that the turnaround at Bed Bath & Beyond is finally under way , but that it takes time. Besides, the board is a heckuva group of people who are diverse, experienced, and highly qualified -- and did we mention they are diverse? The board's response made that point several times, indicating it believes that's highly relevant. Bed Bath & Beyond long ago squandered the opportunity left by the bankruptcy of Linens 'n Things. Instead, it allowed others like Amazon.com , Target , Walmart , and Wayfair to fill the gap. It was late in responding to the rise of the digital marketplace, and began scrambling to bring its omnichannel presence into the modern age only within the last few years. The board has largely failed shareholders by not holding management accountable. Injecting new blood with relevant industry experience could be what spares Bed Bath & Beyond from following Linens 'n Things -- and even Sears -- into the abyss.  10 stocks we like better than Bed Bath & Beyond

66," The stock market finished the week on a positive note, with most major benchmarks gaining ground on Friday. The employment picture in the U.S. improved during March, bouncing back from extremely weak February readings and suggesting that fears of an imminent recession have been greatly exaggerated. Moreover, some companies had good news that sent their shares sharply higher. Scientific Games (NASDAQ: SGMS) , Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK) , and Snap (NYSE: SNAP) were among the top performers. Here's why they did so well. Shares of Scientific Games rose 6% after the digital game and casino equipment provider announced that it had filed a registration statement that would allow its SciPlay subsidiary to go public. SciPlay offers a variety of social games for mobile devices, including well-known franchises Monopoly Slots and Jackpot Party Casino , and it also holds intellectual property rights to develop games with licensed brands like James Bond, Michael Jackson, and the Godfather movie franchise. Even after the IPO, Scientific Games intends to hang onto a majority stake in SciPlay, but many hope that proceeds from an offering of a minority interest will help the parent company pay down some of its outstanding debt.  Image source: Getty Images. Chesapeake Energy's stock enjoyed a 6% gain as the energy company reacted favorably to the rising price of oil. West Texas Intermediate crude oil closed higher by more than $1 per barrel, climbing above the $63 mark and showing signs of strength heading into the key summer driving season. Bulls believe that Chesapeake could easily add to its gains of more than 50% so far this year, as the company has worked hard to boost its exposure to crude oil and try to improve the condition of its balance sheet. Chesapeake still has a lot of debt, and so higher oil prices could help it pay down what it owes a lot faster and provide more money for capital investment, fostering growth. Finally, shares of Snap were higher by 5%. The social media company announced on Thursday that it would add a number of features to its platforms, including a new slate of social games for Snapchat , as well as open up new advertising opportunities on other apps. Several stock analysts weighed in on the moves, with mixed reviews of Snap's strategy. Some analyst companies kept neutral to negative ratings on the stock, but a few upgraded their views or boosted their price targets. At this point, the real question is whether Snap's attempts at innovation will get traction -- because if they don't, it could spell the beginning of the end for the social media company.

With Friday's gains, the benchmark S&P 500 has closed higher for seven trading days in a row, its longest winning streak since October 2017.

""Data like today's takes that off the table.""

69," Bank stocks enthusiastically participated in the post-Christmas rally, but they lost steam in mid-March as Treasury yields pulled back again and have recovered only about half of losses since then. The chart below shows the 6-month stock market performance of the Zacks Major Banks industry, which includes the space's leading players, relative to the S&P 500 index.    JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kick-off the Q1 earnings season for the group on Friday, April 12th, with a host of industry players following suit the following week. In all, we will get Q4 results from more than 20 companies this week, including 6 S&P 500 members. The question is whether these quarterly results can serve as a catalyst for bank stocks? To answer that question, we need to keep in mind that the issue with these stocks has not been a lack of operating performance, but rather big-picture uncertainty. On most key operating metrics, bank performance was been very strong in recent quarters and we will most likely see a repeat performance this earnings season as well. Key parts of the market's worry list for banks include the flattening yield curve and potential for inversion that has implications for the economy's health beyond 2019. The recent change in the Fed's monetary policy stance is essentially an acknowledgment of the same late-cycle narrative. Keep in mind that banks are cyclical businesses engaged in lending and other activities like investment banking, money management, and trading that are always at the mercy of the economic cycle. Banks not only experience low demand for its services when the economic cycle turns down, but the quality of its existing assets (its loan portfolio) also goes down as its customers' credit profiles weaken. Even if we keep aside the market's other worries like trade uncertainty, global growth and political issues, it is this late-cycle worry that has been the big weight on sentiment on bank stocks. That said, it is reasonable to expect that with valuations this compressed already, strong results will give many of these stocks a short-term bump. But a fundamental rerating may be not be possible till the big-picture worries are put to rest. What Are Banks Expected to Earn? Total Q1 earnings for the Zacks Major Banks industry that includes JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and other major industry players are expected to be down -6.5% from the same period last year on -0.8% lower revenues. The decline is primarily a function of tough comparisons, with the year-earlier tally reflecting one-time boost from the tax cut legislation. For the Finance sector as a whole (Major Banks industry brings in roughly 45% of the sector's total earnings), total Q1 earnings are expected to be barely in positive territory; up +0.5% on +6.4% higher revenues. The chart below puts the Finance sector's Q1 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been and where it is expected in the coming periods.    The table below presents the Finance sector earnings picture at the medium industry level.    The 'Earnings Recession' Narrative With earnings growth expectations for the first quarter of 2019 already in negative territory and estimates for 2019 Q2 moving in that direction as well, there is growing talk of an impending earnings recession. This is coming at a time when many in the market are worried about the duration of the current economic cycle that is on track to become the longest in the nation's history later this summer. It is this backdrop that has made market participants overly sensitive to the shape of the Treasury yield curve and its cyclical implications. No doubt, the 'R' word has become potent. So how reasonable are these 'earnings recession' fears? The definition of 'recession' is two or more quarters of negative growth, typically GDP growth. The chart below of quarterly year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 index shows estimates for the current and following three quarters and actual results for the preceding 5 quarters.    To be totally pedantic about it, the recession talk reflects ground reality, as you can see in the chart above. After all, earnings growth in the first two quarters of the year is on track to be negative, even though the 2019 Q2 growth pace is barely in negative territory. We shouldn't take this recession talk too seriously, however. The reason is that the negative growth in the first half of the year is solely because of very tough comparisons. In other words, the base period for 2019 Q1 growth is 2018 Q1, when earnings received a huge boost from the tax-cut legislation. The lower corporate tax rates that showed up in earnings for the first time in 2018 Q1, the base year for 2019 Q1, boosted profitability through margin expansion. As such, we are up against some tough comparisons in 2019. The tax cut legislation didn't have a direct bearing on revenues last year and we are not seeing that much drop off in estimates for this year either, as the chart below shows (orange bars).    So, if the earnings recession is only 'technical', is there nothing to worry about on the earnings front? That's not correct as there are legitimate reasons to be wary of the earnings picture. The earnings growth trajectory would be challenged and difficult even without the issue of the aforementioned tough comparisons as the global economic growth backdrop has become less favorable and cyclical rises in transportation, logistics, payroll and other expenses are squeezing margins. As a result, analysts steadily lowered their estimates for 2019 Q1 as well as full-year 2019, as you can see in the chart below.    The weak guidance from Nike, FedEx (FDX), Walgreen's (WBA) and others in this reporting cycle suggests that we will likely see a replay of what we experienced the las t earnings season that pushed estimates lower. We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q2 evolve as companies report Q1 results and share their outlook for Q2 and beyond. Expectations for 2019 Q1 & the Initial Earnings Report Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be down -4% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. If actual 2019 Q1 earnings growth turns out to be negative, it will be the first earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016. Driving the expected Q1 earnings decline is broad-based margin pressures across all major sectors, with net margins for the index of 11% down from 12% in the year-earlier and 11.8% in the preceding quarter. The Utilities sector is the only one that is expected to have unchanged net margins in 2019 Q1 relative to the year-earlier period, with margins expected to be lower for all of the remaining 15 sectors. Q1 earnings growth is expected to be negative for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with double-digit earnings declines for 5 sectors, including Energy and Technology. For the Technology sector, Q1 earnings are expected to be down -10% from the same period last year on +3% higher revenues and 270 basis points compression in net margins. The table below shows the summary picture for 2019 Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period.    Q1 Scorecard ( as of Friday, April 5th, 2019 ) The market will start paying attention to the start of the earnings season following the quarterly reports from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on April 12th. But these bank earnings reports will not be the first of the Q1 earnings season, as the reporting cycle has actually gotten underway already, with results from 23 S&P 500 members out. All of these early reports, which includes a few bellwethers like FedEx (FDX), Nike (NKE) and others, have fiscal quarters ending in February, which we count as part of our March-quarter tally. For the 23 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results already, total earnings are down -10.8% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 52.2% beating revenue estimates. The Q1 growth for these 23 index is tracking notably below what we had seen in the recent past and positive revenue surprises appear also to be on the weak side, as the comparison charts below show.    It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this admittedly small sample of Q1 results, but it is nevertheless a weak start to the reporting season.

73," By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose to a fresh six-month high on Friday after concerns about an economic slowdown were lessened by U.S. labor market data, while optimism that a trade deal between the United States and China was drawing closer also lifted sentiment. After results some analysts saw as distorted by the partial government shutdown in the prior two months, data showed U.S. employment growth accelerated from a 17-month low in March, buoyed by milder weather. ""February was an unusually weak number, having a bounce back number, the market was expecting that, but if you saw another number that was weak like that it probably would have thrown the market for a loop,"" said Joseph Amato, President and CIO of equities at Neuberger Berman in New York. ""Numbers like this tell you there is still decent momentum here and you are shifting to more trendline growth than the more significant growth that we experienced in the US economy over the last 12 to 18 months.""

Better-than-expected data out of Germany, along with the U.S. jobs report, and a possibly delayed British departure from the European Union also helped boost risk appetite for European shares. German industrial output rose 0.7% in February as mild weather helped a surge in construction activity, although manufacturing production slipped.

75," Shares of LivaNova (NASDAQ: LIVN) are down 27% heading into the closing bell after the medical-device company reported weak preliminary first-quarter revenue results. Specifically, LivaNova's initial tally of sales puts revenue flat year over year, although it would have been up 4% at constant currencies. Unfortunately, that's still below management's guidance for 2019 growth between 5% and 7% on a constant-currency basis.  Image source: Getty Images. Much of the lower-than-expected results came from sales of LivaNova's heart valves, especially the Perceval aortic valve replacement, which were down 11.4% at constant currencies. The company's neuromodulation business in the U.S. was also soft, with sales up just 2.1% year over year at constant currencies. Management blamed increased competition, as well as issues with members of its salesforce leaving for the weak sales. On the plus side, sales outside of the U.S. are on track, and management thinks it can fix the issues in the U.S. Investors will have to wait until LivoNova announces its official first-quarter report on May 1 to get information about how the company plans to turn things around. At that point, investors will also get a look at the earnings line, which presumably will also be disappointing since there wasn't any mention of cost-cutting to match the lower revenue numbers. Management is currently reviewing its 2019 guidance, but it seems inevitable that there will be a downward revision, given the performance in the first quarter.  10 stocks we like better than LivaNova

76," Tech stocks have been among the best performing stocks over the last several years. That trend is likely to continue. But the simple fact is that there are a handful of names that have dramatically outperformed the market while many names underperform. Sector rotations in and out of microchips, software and hardware names send investors running for the hills. The volatility is hard to stomach for investors, let alone traders. Still, the sector spawns new hope of the next big thing or an emerging cash cow. More recently, this market has flashed confusing signals. As we prepare to look at which tech stocks have the best chances for future success, we have to look at some of the recent moves that have investors guessing which way the market will go. NFLX And AAPL Guide Soft The most recen t earnings season could be characterized by profit-taking near the top and a lack of bullish conviction. If the bulls wanted to chase stocks higher, then new highs would have been a near-daily occurrence throughout the recent few months. When we think of tech stocks, of course FANG comes to mind. In terms of recent earnings performance we see a mixed bag from that select group of names. Netflix led the way with disappointing guidance and Facebook followed that with better numbers but still showed concerns on the security front. With two heavy hitters coming on the softer side of things the market weakened. Apple came in with a small beat on top and bottom lines. Importance of Earnings Earnings are what drive stocks. Yes, the charts and timing all play a role in what happens, but at the end of the day it is all about the earnings. We at Zacks have developed a system to tell us which stocks are seeing the best earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank will give you that heads up, but to find the truly best stocks, you have to do more homework than that. A key to understanding why the estimates are moving up is found in analys t report s. The Rank looks at the estimate changes from all the major brokerages, but the devil is in the details. Just like the recent moves in AAPL and FB and NFLX, we can make some broader assumptions about the tech space and therefore get into the best position possible to ride this market through year end. Where Growth Is Great Not all growth is valued the same by all investors. This concept really suggests that only the best type of growth is worth investing in. The recent swings in the market tell me that investors are really interested in the growth from only certain tech names. Stocks with pricing power have seen stronger moves higher than those without. The concept is simply that demand is still very strong across the board, but that pricing power can help the company expand margins and those fatter margins lead to larger profits.

As we wrap up the 1Q results and begin to look forward to what 2Q will bring, we are reminded of how strong that quarter was as well. Headline after headline around that earnings season suggested that the bears had one less leg to stand on…and this was among their strongest arguments. The idea was that the solid earnings performance reduced valuations across the board, a long held battle cry of the shorts. Those strong reports from the past have a way of being a problem in the future. They will present some tough comparisons in the coming quarters, so there could be some ""headline shock"" coming for multiple stocks. Finding good stocks that don't have this roadblock will be critical to success.

85," BUENOS AIRES, April 5 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's executive board ratified on Friday its third review of Argentina's economic progress under a major financing deal agreed last year, unlocking a roughly $10.8 billion tranche of funds. The IMF said in a statement the board had approved an agreement with Argentina struck with a staff-level team last month, a boost for President Mauricio Macri as he grapples with renewed volatility in the market ahead of October elections. Argentina agreed on a $56.3 billion standby financing deal with the fund last year when Latin America's No. 3 economy was battered by rampant inflation and a run on the peso currency, which lost half its value against the U.S. dollar. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, said in a statement the measures were ""bearing fruit"" and there were signs of revival in the economy despite inflation ""proving difficult to break."" ""Economic activity contracted in 2018 but there are signs that the recession has bottomed out, and a gradual recovery is expected to take hold in the coming quarters,"" she said. The third review report, released later, said Argentina's economy would likely contract 1.2 percent this year, an improvement on the IMF's previous forecast of a 1.7 percent contraction. It forecast 2019 inflation of 30.5 percent. It added the October election was the ""most visible near-term risk,"" saying it could raise market anxiety and lead to larger-than-expected peso outflows and ""renewed concerns about debt dynamics"". Lagarde added the government needed ""continued prudence"" in executing its spending plans and strengthening revenues to meet a 2019 target of achieving a primary fiscal balance. An Argentine Treasury official, asking not to be named, said the program was going as expected and that the view inside government was that a recovery had already begun. The official added that no further major spending cuts were planned. ",-29.109999999999673,0

The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice.

88," HOUSTON, April 5 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday targeted oil shipments from Venezuela to Cuba in its latest round of sanctions to pressure the government of President Nicolas Maduro, aiming to choke off a crucial supply of crude to the Communist island. The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Venezuelan state-run oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A, or PDVSA , and also on two companies and a vessel that delivered oil to Cuba in February and March. ""Treasury is taking action against vessels and entities transporting oil, providing a lifeline to keep the illegitimate Maduro regime afloat,"" said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in a statement. The latest round of U.S. sanctions, announced earlier by Vice President Mike Pence in a speech in Houston, aim to further undermine Maduro's government after the United States and most Western nations recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the rightful president of Venezuela. Guaido invoked the Venezuelan constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate. ",-29.109999999999673,0
89," Shares of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) were moving higher last month after the warehouse retailer turned in another strong quarterly earnings report, beating profit estimates and posting strong comparable-store sales growth. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence , the stock gained 11% in March. As the chart below shows, the stock jumped on the earnings report and gained from there as optimism built.  COST data by YCharts. Costco shares rose 5% on March 8 following its second-quarter earnings report. The company showed off another round of impressive comparable-store sales as adjusted comps rose 6.7% and e-commerce sales jumped 26%. That drove overall revenue up 7.3% to $35.4 billion, which was a bit short of estimates at $35.7 billion.  Image source: Costco. Margins also improved as operating income was up 18.4% to $1.2 billion, and earnings per share jumped from $1.59 to $2.01, which was well ahead of estimates at $1.69. CFO Richard Galanti noted an improved selection of products online, including Apple iMacs and MacBooks, and said the company was expanding its supply chain with new meat and poultry processing plants, and a new bakery in Canada. Costco doesn't provide guidance, but with the economy looking strong after the latest jobs report and a potential resolution to the U.S.-China trade war, the retailer is in good shape for continued gains. Costco recently announced that its little-known auto program saw a 25% increase in sales last year to 650,000, further evidence of the unique benefits that members get and the staying power of Costco's business model. The company did say that adjusted comps were up just 4.3% in February and e-commerce sales increased 21.6%, but it blamed bad weather in North America and a shift in the lunar new year for that slowdown. Without those impacts, growth would have been similar to earlier in the year, the company said. Nonetheless, Costco's growth plan remains on track as the company showed again why it's a best-in-class retailer. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call
April 05, 2019 , 11:00 a.m. ET Operator Hello and welcome to the Greenbrier Companies' Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Each analyst should limit themselves to only two questions. Until that time, all lines will be in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Greenbrier Companies, this conference call is being recorded for instant replay purposes. At this time, I'd like to turn over the conference over to Mr. Justin Roberts, Vice President and Treasurer. Mr. Roberts, you may begin. Justin M. Roberts -- Vice President, Corporate Finance & Treasurer Thank you, Angela. Good morning. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. On today's call. I'm joined by Greenbrier's Chairman and CEO, Bill Furman; Lorie Tekorius, Executive Vice President and COO; and Adrian Downes, Senior Vice President and Acting CFO. They will discuss the results for the quarter and provide an outlook for Greenbrier's business in fiscal 2019. Following our introductory remarks, we will open up the call for questions. In addition to the press release issued this morning, which includes supplemental data, additional financial information and key metrics can be found in a slide presentation posted today on the IR section of our website. Matters discussed on today's conference call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Throughout our discussion today, we will describe some of the important factors that could cause Greenbrier's actual results in 2019 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of Greenbrier. And with that, I'll ask Bill to take it away. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Okay. Thank you very much. Justin, and good morning, everyone. Highlights of Greenbrier's second fiscal quarter included solid railcar order activity and increased railcar deliveries and revenue generation, but our financial performance in the quarter was obviously disappointing. Our 2019 plan indemnified our second quarter as the least profitable of the year, due in part to expected manufacturing inefficiencies from production line changeovers and building of a fleet of cars for syndication. However, we also encountered three distinct headwinds mentioned in our press release that impacted profitability in the quarter, specifically challenges in manufacturing at our Romanian and Gunderson facilities and facility closure costs and railcar repair operations. These factors caused second quarter earnings per share to fall short of our goals. Despite these challenges, during the quarter, our projected deliveries and revenue for the year remain on target. However, we now estimate fiscal 2019 earnings per share in the range of $3.60 to $3.80, excluding the railcar contract loss accruals and facility closure costs incurred during the quarter. Adrian will discuss our second quarter financial results and full-year financial guidance in more detail. While lower than our previous outlook, we are confident in Greenbrier's ability to perform within this range. We have identified the core issues creating the negative financial performance in our Romanian facilities, in particular in our Gunderson operations in our railcar repair network. By far, the Romanian operations were the most significant and we believe we have a new handle on that with new management under the leadership of longtime Greenbrier officer, William Glenn, who used to run our European operations and has recently rejoined the Company. We are also making rapid progress in addressing other performance issues that impacted the quarter. I'll briefly offer observations on the current conditions we see in the market and potential impact to our business. Recent macroeconomic data in the case of the US economy is still growing at a slightly phase in excess of 2.2% of GDP real growth, core inflation remains low at approximately 2% and the US Federal Reserve is projecting no interest rate hikes in 2019 and continues to signal cautiously into 2020. Overall, low inflation and less restrictive monetary policy in the United States and North America should allow for GDP expansion throughout the balance of the year into 2020 and possibly into 2021. Throughout March, North American rail traffic is down year-over-year. This is in part due to harsh winter weather conditions and declines in some commodity areas. Although car loadings are down, intermodal activity remains fairly constant from 2018 levels and train velocity continues to be negative -- Greenbrier continues to -- and part of that is due of course to weather and flooding. Greenbrier continues to closely monitor the rollout of precision scheduled railroading, also known as PSR, at various Class 1 railroads. While this is not a new initiative and is not being implemented by all railroads, it is a trend that merits attention, and we're tracking it closely. It has both potential negatives and potential positives to car builders and leasing companies. Although Greenbrier is not presently experiencing any direct impact from PSR, we put to act on any effects it may produce over time in the railroad equipment and services market. One of our defining characteristics is the ability to navigate shifting market dynamics with responsive products and services and to address issues when they arise. So, we hope to get past this quarter and begin a more normalized performance pattern. Our strategy of reinforcing the core North American market is succeeding with almost all fiscal 2019 production slots filled and moving into 2020, our integrated team is working to fulfill and fill those. In Europe, customer inquiries remained solid. Greenbrier AstraRail is in active negotiations with several railcar fleet owners for multi-year orders. There has also been considerable activity in the intermodal sector in Europe, in part driven by the availability of EU funds designed to take container traffic off the roads to help the continent meet its ambitious carbon reduction goals. Finally, in Brazil, the economy gained momentum in February after a pause during the Presidential transition. During fiscal 2019, we focused on strategically reorganizing size with manufacturers. So facilities there operate as part of our Greenbrier-Maxion joint venture. We believe we're well positioned as a gradual economic recovery and the grants our rail concessions takes hold in this year. Our long-term view of the opportunity in Brazil remains very positive. Greenbrier expects a stronger finish to the second half of fiscal 2019. As we have indicated before, our strategy is to continue to deliver on the four elements we articulated at the beginning of fiscal 2019, reinforcing our core North American markets, executing on our international strategy, although we believe that footprint will be stabilized and not be expanding, we won't be emphasizing additional growth other than those things that we've announced, robust development number three of the talent pipeline and continuing to grow the business at a larger scale. With that, I'll turn it back to Laurie and Justin. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. I'll briefly provide some more detail on our operating performance before Adrian addresses the financial detail. We delivered 5,100 railcar units and received orders for approximately 3,800 units valued at nearly $450 million. Orders in the quarter were for a broad range of car types, including covered hoppers, automotive carrying railcars and tank cars. Our diversified backlog as of quarter end totaled 26,000 units with an estimated value of $2.7 billion. As Bill mentioned and as detailed in our press releases of today and March 22nd, challenges in Romania, Gunderson and our railcar repair operations negatively impacted results in the quarter by $0.29 per share, which includes $0.14 related to loss accruals on certain railcar contracts and facility closure costs. With about 95% of 2019 production booked, manufacturing execution is critical, and we believe we've identified the right solutions to achieve our updated performance targets in the second half of the year. I'll now give a bit more color on those solutions. First, in Europe, as Bill said, effective February 1st, William Glenn rejoined Greenbrier as the CEO of Greenbrier AstraRail, our integrated European rail operation, with facilities in Romania, Poland and Turkey. William initially joined Greenbrier in 2003, and over 13 years at Greenbrier, he held several executive positions in both North America and Europe. William's familiarity with Greenbrier, its European operations, which recently doubled in size and its expertise and operational turnaround will expedite the required changes in Europe. In his new role, William directs all European strategic and commercial activity, and he'll work closely with Martin Graham, our Executive Vice President of Manufacturing, who adds Chief Operating Officer of Greenbrier AstraRail to his responsibilities. Together, William and Martin have a mandate to improve operating profitability in Greenbrier Europe. Second, at Gunderson, we expect operational and financial improvement at Gunderson as we restart our railcar production line and eliminate the distraction of production automation activities and hit our stride in marine, where in January, we received an order from Overseas Shipholding Group, OSG, to construct the second 204,000 barrel oil and chemical ATB barge. And lastly, in repair, since we regained direct control of our North American railcar repair shops in September, we've been strategically reviewing the network. At unprofitable locations, we first focused our efforts on improving the volume and mix of work. After this, if we determined that a location cannot be profitable, we explore the sale to another operator before reaching a final determination to cease operations In the second quarter, after ensuring fair treatment was given to our employees, we announced plans to conclude operations at two repair locations. And although the repair site evaluation continues, we are optimistic about the progress we've made in rationalizing our network and intend to achieve significantly improved operating performance by the end of 2019. Beyond the challenges presented in the quarter, there were several positives to share. Leasing revenue was particularly strong resulting from a substantial uptick in syndication activity. And to meet syndication demand, some of this product was sourced from outside of our own manufacturing operations. Excluding those products, gross margin in leasing and services exceeded 51%. Also in the second quarter, Greenbrier Management Services, our proprietary rail management provider, grew its customer base with seven new customers under contract while securing several multi-year renewals from existing customers. Wheels and parts were also positive contributors to Greenbrier's performance. As Bill mentioned, winter weather slowed railcar loadings, but it was a tailwind to our wheels business. One-third of our wheels locations operated on a seven-day schedule through the winter months to meet high demand. Our Parts group also delivered a strong quarter led by the production of boxcar doors from our Ohio facility and continued demand for end-of-car cushioning units from our Iowa operations. Moving beyond our North American and European operations, Brazil remains a challenging environment, but the economy is improving. And with our joint venture partners, Amsted Rail and Iochpe-Maxion, we've sized our operations to be poised to respond when rail demand improves. Greenbrier continues to pursue opportunities to achieve growth at scale. We endeavor to do this for scale, actuates the other elements of our strategy and reinforcing the Company's position in core North American markets, executing in international railcar markets and growing our talent pipeline for the future. Although we encountered obstacles in the second quarter, everything we faced is addressable and solutions are under way to achieve the goals for 2019 and beyond. Our team is dedicated to meeting our objectives, and we continue to be excited about what the future holds for Greenbrier. Adrian, I'll turn it over to you to talk about the quarterly financials and our full year guidance. Adrian J. Downes -- Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer & Acting Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Lorie, and good morning, everyone. Quarterly financial information and metrics are available in the press release and supplemental slides on our website. Given the discussion so far, I'll focus on a few additional details in the quarter and then provide additional information on our fiscal year 2019 guidance. Highlights for the second quarter include ne t earnings attributable to Greenbrier of $2.8 million or $0.08 per share, including $4.7 million net of tax or $0.14 per share of railcar contract loss accruals and manufacturing and closure costs and repair operations. Adjusted EBITDA of $37.4 million included $7.6 million of an impact from the contract loss accruals and closure costs. Revenue was $658.7 million, up 9% sequentially. Almost 30% of our 5,100 units delivered were outside the North American market. Internally produced syndication activity accounted for another 1,200 units delivered in the quarter. 10% to 15% of the order activity in the quarter was from international markets. Orders continue to be broad-based across a variety of railcar types and customers. Aggregate gross margin of 8.2% was below our expectations as a result of the factors already mentioned. As we move beyond the production disruptions in the second quarter, we expect gross margins to move back into the double-digits during the second half of the year. We continue to be focused on growing the business and remain optimistic about the opportunities supported by our balance sheet strengths and flexibility. Available liquidity of almost $900 million, including over $340 million of cash, position us well to support our strategic objective to grow at scale. I'm going to spend a few extra minutes discussing the working capital growth that has occurred over the last two quarters, much of which is driven by increasing business activity levels. Inventory balances increased, reflecting preparation for substantially higher expected production rates in the second half of fiscal 2019 as well as the outsourcing of lining work on several car types. This has increased the length of time to produce cars, meaning they're staying in inventory longer than is typical, and this will reverse in the fourth quarter as additional internal lining capacity is brought online. All else being equal, we expect cash balances to exceed $500 million by the end of the year. We continue to focus on activities that emphasize cash flow generation and return on capital employed. We believe this approach will continue to create long-term shareholder value supported by our history of steady dividend increases over the last several years. We are confident in our dividend policy, and the $0.25 per share quarterly dividend announced today is our 20th consecutive quarterly dividend and represents a yield of over 3%. Based on current business trends, we are updating our fiscal 2019 guidance. Deliveries should be approximately 24,000 to 26,000 units, which includes about 2,000 units from Greenbrier-Maxion in Brazil. Revenue will exceed $3 billion, diluted EPS of $3.60 to $3.80 excluding the $0.14 per share related to railcar contract loss accrual and closure costs in Q2. Our updated earnings guidance reflects the impact of Q2 as well as somewhat lowered earnings expectations for the balance of the year in the affected operations. The majority of our prior guidance is unchanged. Operating cash flow will be positive, and given the earnings trajectory, we will be weighted to the back end of the year. G&A expense of $205 million to $210 million includes continued support for strategic initiatives, including investments in our talent base. We will continue to rebalance our lease fleet and expect gains on sale of about $40 million on $120 million of proceeds from those sales. Similar to 2018, we intend to continue adding to our fleet with expected investments of about $100 million. We expect capital expenditures of $105 million in manufacturing and wheels repair and parts. Combined with our fleet activity, our net capital expenditure will be about $75 million. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be $80 million to $85 million, and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates are expected to be breakeven to modestly positive in 2019. We expect 2019 earnings attributable to non-controlling interest to be about $40 million and our consolidated tax rate for 2019 is expected to be 25% to 26%. Our rate will fluctuate due to the geographic mix o f earnings and other discrete items. Operator, we'll now open it up for questions. Operator, we'll now open it up for questions. Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open. Justin Long -- Stephens -- Analyst Thanks and good morning. So, I wanted to start with a question on the $7.6 million charge that you called out, can you share how much of that was allocated to the wheels and parts segment and how much of that was allocated to the manufacturing segment? And then, just thinking about manufacturing margins, is there a way to size up the operational headwind that you saw from Europe and Gunderson, just curious if there's a way to quantify what that was in the quarter? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Yeah. So, the the closure costs in our repair business was $1.1 million. So, the other items related to manufacturing at $6.5 million. So the bulk of that was in manufacturing. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer And Justin, could you repeat the rest of your question? Sorry, I got a little bit lost. Justin Long -- Stephens -- Analyst Sure, no problem. Second part was just on the operational headwinds in Europe and Gunderson, and if there was any way to call out what that impact was as we think about a more normalized margin going forward? Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Right, So I would say that we did have headwinds beyond what we talked about on the job loss accruals. We have some definite inefficiencies in both Europe and Gunderson that are part of the larger number that we called out in the earnings release. You've been through our shops, you know that these things don't necessarily turn on a dime. But we didn't wait until the quarter finished to start making adjustments. So we've had activities under way and we expect modest improvement in the third quarter and even better improvement in the fourth. Justin Long -- Stephens -- Analyst Okay. And then, for my second question, I wanted to circle back to a comment that you made, Bill, that you won't be emphasizing growth in some of the international markets beyond what you've already announced. Can you just comment on your longer-term view of the international businesses? I'm curious if your opinion on the earnings power or margin potential in those international businesses has changed or is this just simply a case where the processes in Europe aren't where they need to be and now you've changed management and we should see the issues resolved pretty quickly? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors I'll just simply -- with regard to international strategy, we believe that it will ultimately result in diversity of revenue and earnings by having footprints in different locations. However, given the nature of the hit in Europe and the disappointments there, we need to regroup and ensure that we have all of that under control. We're also working carefully in Brazil, the GCC and Turkey, which has really small footprint right now. We think that it's best to consolidate our activities and have a strong profitable base before we do more to expand. Those are the regions where we are currently operating. So I think that answers both aspects of your question. Adrian J. Downes -- Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer & Acting Chief Financial Officer And Justin, we did call out $0.29 of performance issues at those units that did include loss contract accruals as well as the closure costs. Justin M. Roberts -- Vice President, Corporate Finance & Treasurer Yeah. Not at all the units I mentioned but just in Europe, the Gunderson facility, and then the continuing assimilation of the shop network at -- within our wheels and parts group, but it's the repair business. The actual wheel and parts business, as Lorie mentioned, offset some of that in the repair side. Justin Long -- Stephens -- Analyst Okay. That's helpful. And one just last quick modeling question on incentive comp. Could you comment on how that assumption has changed versus your prior forecast? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Our incentive comp goes down if our expectations go down, and Lorie can probably give more precise figure, Justin, or answer to that. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer I think that thought on is yes. As our results decline, our incentive compensation declines. We also -- the incentive compensation is expensed pro rata consistent with when we have quarters of earnings. So, we would expect higher -- if the back half is going to have higher earnings, it will have higher expense. Justin Long -- Stephens -- Analyst Okay. But there is not a dollar amount that you can share that in terms of the change from prior guidance to the guidance you gave today? Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer No, not at this time. Justin Long -- Stephens -- Analyst Okay, fair enough. I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time. Justin M. Roberts -- Vice President, Corporate Finance & Treasurer Thank you, Justin. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen. Your line is open. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Good morning. Matt Elkott -- Cowen -- Analyst Good morning. How are you guys? First, I have just a maintenance question on the guidance. I want make sure I got this right. Did you guys say that the net gain on disposition of equipment guidance was unchanged at around $40 million? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors That's correct. Matt Elkott -- Cowen -- Analyst Okay. So, the second half should be lower because the first half, if you annualize it, would be closer to $52 million. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Exactly, yes. The Q3 and Q4 will be at a lower run rate. Matt Elkott -- Cowen -- Analyst Okay, that's very helpful. My next question is, based on your expected deliveries for the second half, the 95% that's already in the backlog, I think you will be left with just over 11,000 units beyond fiscal 2019. So, how much of that or what percentage of that is for 2020 or beyond? And based on the current order activity and the delivery schedules, do you think 2020 could be an EPS growth year? Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer We always seek to have the next year be an EPS growth year. Regarding where we sit right now on backlog and how our production space is filled into 2020, we're feeling good, but we're also in the rail freight business so we never feel really good. Our guys are working hard every day to fill that space. We do have some orders that continue into 2021. I don't think any beyond 2021, maybe just a little bit, but I would say the bulk of the backlog that goes from out of 2019 is in 2020 with a little bit going into 2021 and 2022. It's hard for me to think about years that big. Matt Elkott -- Cowen -- Analyst Okay. And Lorie, how has the order and inquiry activity been since the end of the quarter? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Since the end of the quarter, we continue to see a lot of visibility in various tank car markets, plastics and other derivative products. We are also seeing a strong demand in some commodity types, (inaudible) for example, a little weaker demand in some car types. But in general, we think we have very good momentum into 2020 and even some visibility as Lorie mentioned into 2021. Matt Elkott -- Cowen -- Analyst Okay. So, on the tank car front, Bill, you mentioned, I guess, the tank car outlook continues to be pretty positive or have you seen any recent signs that customers are maybe having second thoughts on pulling the trigger on those orders? And also, what are the manufacturing lead times for tank cars? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors The lead times are anywhere from six to 12 months depending on the type. We haven't seen a lot of hesitation. But I would suggest that we don't want to confuse the mix, and I think it's all crude by rail. There is a broad tank car segment that has a lot of activity going on in it. Matt Elkott -- Cowen -- Analyst Okay. Do you have a sense of how much of the tank car activity is for replacement of older tank cars versus new demand? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors I think that's a significant factor. Matt Elkott -- Cowen -- Analyst Okay. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors But I already have a statistic to share. Matt Elkott -- Cowen -- Analyst Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Thank you, Matt. Matt Elkott -- Cowen -- Analyst Thanks, Matt. Operator Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst Hi, guys. Good morning. Laurie, I wanted to go back, I think you were talking about automation and some of the issues that you had in the quarter, can you just give us your high level thoughts as automation is just not a process, it's going to work and railcar manufacturing, is it something that you're reworking to go back, any thoughts there? Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Right. So, Allison, thank you for that question. No, we are firmly embracing automation in all of our facilities, Mexico and in North America manufacturing as well as our aftermarkets business where we can look at ways that we can deploy automation to improve the quality, improve efficiencies in our shop, and it actually gives our employees an opportunity to learn how to work the automation. So it's not just the focus on trying to eliminate headcount. So, if I misspoke during my prepared remarks, what I intended to say is that it was a distraction at Gunderson. It's not that it didn't work or that we're stepping away from it, but it's just cost management to be a bit distracted with their time. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors And I just add that we have about 20 people in a team that continues to work on automation. And that particular project which was for key sub-assembly on the cars we are replacing Chinese content with North American content, we are intending to replace that sub-assembly at Gunderson. The supplier we chose and the execution on the job didn't work out to our expectations, and we had to regroup. But we are going to continue with the Gunderson facility particularly to automate as appropriate, and it's highly appropriate in that setting. Allison Poliniak -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst Okay, that's helpful. And then -- so you touched on PSR to some extent. I think everybody is very familiar with the negative impact of cars, but you did say there are positives. Could you maybe expand on that a little bit? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Yeah, the PSR is different things to different railroads, different things to different people. For some shippers, it's a very big negative, and I think for the railroad industry in particular, if they lose touch with the shipper community, it could cause low back as (inaudible) has mentioned that BNSF is not entirely -- has not been a great subscriber to PSR as it relates to the effect on the customer base of potential regulation that it might bring in the future. We all operate through customers. And if we can't have -- if we don't have customers and we concentrate only on internal metrics that particularly are short-term, it can damage the long-term franchise value of the business. I think that there is a great debate going on among railroad operating people, and yes, we're certainly seeing efficiencies rising at Union Pacific through PSR and other railroads. But it's leaving some of the shippers looking at other ways to call their freight, and some of those other ways can be through creative programs that can benefit leasing companies and car builders as they aggregate demand in the North American network. Adrian J. Downes -- Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer & Acting Chief Financial Officer Bill, if I could add just one other point on to that, for companies that are innovative that have strong engineering departments like Greenbrier, we have (ph) three of introducing new more efficient railcar designs, and that is attractive to companies that are implementing PSR. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Exactly. Allison Poliniak -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst Got it. And are you starting to see some of that sort of those increase come in at this point? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors We've been working with several of these customers over the last several quarters, and I would be -- the short answer is yes. Allison Poliniak -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst Great. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bascome Majors -- Susquehanna Financial Group -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my questions here. You talked a little about growing the business acquisitively, you're adding some verticals domestically. Can you talk a little bit about what kinds of business you're not in, in North America, that you'd like to get in, or what you could use to supplement the existing portfolio? Adrian J. Downes -- Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer & Acting Chief Financial Officer Our management services business has grown from $10 million a year in EBITDA to $25 million a year in EBITDA over the last several years -- of last 10 years, and that's a significant number. We think that that business is crucial for business. And we like that business since it's essential to our syndication and leasing and manufacturing strategy. So we are internally growing that business. We also think that finding core businesses I have, those are the areas we're concentrating on for growth. I'm not sure we said that we -- where -- well, I obviously leave it at that. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer And I would say, I would add on to that, right, with the technology, our management services afford us, and we touched over 200,000 of the north of 300,000... Adrian J. Downes -- Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer & Acting Chief Financial Officer 300,00 0, yeah. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer ...cars in the North American fleet. So we have access to a lot of information. And by using technology to think I think about things like preventative maintenance, ways that we can help to service our customers better is how we think about how we might vertically integrate or integrate across our existing lines of business. Bascome Majors -- Susquehanna Financial Group -- Analyst Okay. I apologize I took the comments about not looking to grow the footprint about as a signal that there were some capital deployment opportunities domestically to grow the business acquisitively. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Well, we're not saying that there -- we're not denying that. We have a very strong balance sheet. And if we can employ the capital at a double-digit rate of return, obviously that would be the best thing for shareholders in addition to dividends. We think there are opportunities in the core business to do that. All I intended to say is that we want to be sure that our international businesses are on strong footing. So we have some work to do in Europe for the next couple of quarters to put that ship right on the water. Bascome Majors -- Susquehanna Financial Group -- Analyst I think it's a good segue to the next question here. I mean, it sounds like you've got some challenges that Gunderson certainly some challenges in Eastern Europe, but the core Mexico manufacturing operation is performing pretty well here, and you seem pretty confident in the profit and cash flow outlook for at least the next two or three quarters here. Looking back, you haven't bought your share since 2016, stocks down almost 50% in the last six months, trades at a pretty significant discount to some of your peers in the place. You've got $100 million buyback plan in place. Why wouldn't now be the time to act more aggressively on your own stock? Is that a good place to allocate capital today? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Our Board looks at capital allocation every quarter. We -- on that subject, we have robust conversations. I think as the balance of this fiscal year plays out, you'll see us take some definite steps on capital allocation. We always are looking at trade-off between dividends and stock buybacks in terms of return and total shareholder return. But -- and I wouldn't comment further beyond that, but we are very focused on capital allocation, and we definitely discuss this at our Board meeting every time we have one. Bascome Majors -- Susquehanna Financial Group -- Analyst Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the time, guys. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Thank you, Bascome. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Thank you, Bascome. Operator Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Steve Barger -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, everybody. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Good morning, Steve. Steve Barger -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst You talked about getting cash balance back to $500 million by year-end as working capital versus, but I'm curious of the net impact of the international businesses will be positive or negative free cash flow this year? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors That's a good question. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer That is an excellent question. I would say that... William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Should we talk about hope or should we talk about (inaudible)? Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer I believe what our forecast currently show is that will be modestly positive but they won't be the vast majority of what driving our free cash flow that will be the North American market. Steve Barger -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst And do you feel like you have visibility as you go into next year to see a positive reversal there or is that kind of a longer-term ramp to seeing those international businesses be free cash flow contributors? Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Well, Bill regularly tells me I'm not allowed to have feelings. But yes, I believe -- I believe that we will continue to see as the operations improve, we expect to see that flow through to operating cash flow as well. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Just a little color on that. The thing that happened in Europe was, and I bear some responsibility here, we rely heavily on European management. We do have a controlled Supervisory Board, but we made some bad decisions. In particular, we've been buffeted by supply problems over there, (inaudible) brakes, for example, in Europe has gone through a recent reorganization and management buyout or private equity buyout, things have really gotten bad. There they have virtually a monopoly. We're going to seek regulatory intervention, because they've been very slow to provide not just to us but to other builders and repair facilities, the necessary brake systems, and they failed in their responsibility in that regard. So, these issues are being addressed, and I think that's the one that lingers. But we are accepting orders. We tried to put 10 pounds and 5 pound bag through the enthusiasm of the local group. I think that we will have a more disciplined and orderly input of orders there. So we will take orders that are profitable, and we will also avoid the state-owned enterprises that put penalties, which can -- and sometimes be addressed by fortunately Europe. So, I think we have a much better prospect. We exactly understand what happened and we know what to do about it. And I feel confident that by the fourth quarter we'll see huge risk reversal of headwinds to tailwinds there. Steve Barger -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Got it. That's good detail. Thanks. And Bill, just to clarify your earlier comments on demand levels for railcars, have inquiry to order conversions remained steady with what you were seeing last year domestically and internationally? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Yes. Steve Barger -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Good. And Justin, can you clarify the comment on how new car designs specifically go to benefit PSR? Justin M. Roberts -- Vice President, Corporate Finance & Treasurer So if you go into a customer, let's call it a Class 1 railroad 10 years ago, and you would have said, we can take six feet out of a railcar and still maintain the heated capacity, you may or may not have had much of an audience. If you go into a path right now and say the same thing, they're very interested in understanding how they can put more railcars into a train and carry more cubic capacities. Steve Barger -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Got it, OK. And last one from me. It's probably too early to talk about this, but if we do get into an order slowdown and deliveries were to decline next year, what are the mitigation plans for the manufacturing footprint to minimize detrimental margins? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Two significant ones that we are implementing in a test case in Brazil, rightsizing factories to stabilize the workforce and to improve margins by not going after market share only. Brazil is a very interesting country where there are only two car builders. For example, we are the -- have the largest market share, but I think we're running -- we have been running Brazil with too many workers for the volume that can be obtained at the current levels. When and if in North America we see the next decline and certainly will be when not if, this flexible footprint that we have in Mexico where we can size the factories quite quickly needs to be expanded -- extended to Gunderson, it needs to be extended and used actively in Europe. Because you can end up putting the cart before the horse having a facility is too large. And then competing for orders that are not truly profitable because you're simply supporting the workforce. I think it's easy for a car builder if you're not paying attention to drift into that, and that's a primary thing that we are doing. I think the second point just is that half of our facilities or more than half in North America are highly flexible, and we can add and deduct employees pretty easily. In the United States, it's harder because all manufacturers, all businesses are coping with the change in demographic in the workforce, and I think we have to look at not adding and deducting in United States but rather a stable workforce base, and then just going after the business that will support that base. Steve Barger -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Understood. Thanks for the time. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Brooklier with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. Matt Brooklier -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst Yes, thanks and good morning. No, it's kind of a smaller part of your manufacturing business. But can you talk about how much revenue you booked at marine during the fiscal second quarter and maybe a little bit more color on where the backlog currently sits? Justin M. Roberts -- Vice President, Corporate Finance & Treasurer Bill, now this is Justin. The marine revenue in the quarter was between $10 million to $15 million, probably closer to $10 million, and we expect it to ramp up to a more sustainable range of around kind of $15 million in the -- for the next several quarters. With the two large barges, we received orders for from OSG. We've got visibility extending deep into calendar 2020 at this point. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors The other thing about marine though is, it can't be measured by the size of the revenue. It absorbs by its nature of its business. It absorbs a great deal of overhead at the facility. So the economics of that business combined with railcars there creates a different dynamic. So marine business is very important part of Gunderson. We see -- we had pretty good visibility out into 2021 in that business with two barges we've got and the other things in the pipeline. Matt Brooklier -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst Okay. So it sounds like part of the Gunderson margin improvement story is partially related to work ramping up on the marine side and getting more of the fixed cost absorption. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Exactly. Got it. Matt Brooklier -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst Yeah. And then, if you talk a little bit about it, kind of the cadence of earnings in the second half of this year maybe talk to the expectations for deliveries on what's left as I look at what's you've delivered, year-to-date sales and use the midpoint of your guidance ex Brazil, right, we're talking about 14,300 cars, in the past you've talked about maybe percentages of when we should anticipate kind of the magnitude of deliveries. But just a little bit more color on the deliveries, I think, would be helpful. Thanks. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors You will see a meaningful step up in Q3, and then another meaningful step up in Q4. I would say that it's probably maybe a 20% increase roughly in Q3, and then another maybe 10% to 15% increase in Q4. Part of this is that again, as we've been saying this fiscal year, Q2 was positioning us to increase our production rate in the back half of the year that is already occurring and we will be stabilizing in Q3 with our run rate exiting in Q4. Matt Brooklier -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst Okay. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer The other thing that I would -- the other thing I would add on to that, Justin, that we've talked about, which has been a consumer cash flow that we do have a number of assets on the balance sheet that we expect to syndicate in the third and fourth quarters, so you'll see additional volume there. Matt Brooklier -- Buckingham Research -- Analyst Got it. Okay. Thank you for the color. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ken Hoexter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey, Bill. If I could just revisit your prior answer there, the flexibility in the US on your cost side and Europe versus Mexico. I mean, just simply because of unionization, it's going to be much more difficult to flex in -- I'd like to understand your -- versus Mexico, is that what you were saying where you have much more flexibility? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors No, it's actually the opposite. We are not unionized in Gunderson, and we are unionized in Mexico. But the unions and nature of unions in Mexico are not exactly like they are in United States so that you can add or deduct workers. But what I meant to say just in simple terms is, we're going to try to size the facilities to the market. We're going to try to produce to work on a sustained volume that will fit the size of those facilities. What we used to do and what railcar builders used to do is, if they had a surge of business they've gotten higher, a lot of new employees and then if the surge -- as the surge past, they would lay off workers. I don't think anyone in this environment and probably in the foreseeable future looking at demographics of age and work preference will be able to afford to do that or that it's a sustainable model. I think instead we focus on a flexible workforce with some contract workers, you will have a core set of highly trained people, you will retain and you will put business in different facilities into more flexible facilities where you can add or deduct labor. So, I think that -- I've seen this all around not just us but other builders too where -- when you are trying to increase the workforce and then decrease it rapidly, it creates all kinds of pain and sorrow. Safety statistics decline, safety is one of our most important -- is our most important priority, and you also have a real impact on quality, reliability, and it's just that things have changed in the workforce. We can't do it the way we used to do. So, what we're doing is getting a core facility with a core fleet of work and trying to make that work more profitable with higher margins. That means that like precision railroading, we're going to turn away some customers that have been used to buying very cheaply relative to other car types or other customers. Ken Hoexter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. Great clarification. Thanks for that. Then let me keep on the cost side just for one more, on SG&A, you had a big up quarter last quarter, down slightly year-over-year this quarter. Maybe on a lower if you have any thoughts on spending, is that a lever based on kind of market demand and as you flow or maybe kind of just thoughts on the SG&A side. Lorie L. Tekorius -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Sure, Ken. I think we touched a little bit on the fact that we would expect SG&A to step up a bit in the second half of the year just from an incentive compensation perspective, so -- because we record those expenses as we generate the earnings. Now, if we can't do everything that we've been trying to explain to you guys that we plan to do in the second half (inaudible) occur. We don't have any other that jump to mind significant movements and what would be driving SG&A to be materially different from kind of taking, let's say, an average of the first half of 2019. Ken Hoexter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Okay. And then, lastly for me, just to follow up on Allison's question. Bill, you mentioned the kind of positives on PSR, can you talk about the other side? Have you had any orders that got eliminated? I mean, if not more than half the group that's jumped on it in the past, call it, six months with (inaudible), has there been a change of order process through that -- through your discussions? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors I think Justin more or less nailed it specifically on the design -- service design aspect of a freight car. We and at least one other builder have really advanced the art there, and it's not -- it's probably not rocket science, but that's been a big plus. And on the negative side, it hasn't affected us yet. We have -- we are closely watching velocity. There is, of course, an issuing in velocity right now because of the floods. As soon as we have more normalized weather, I think we'll be able to have a better understanding probably by the next quarter. But we haven't really seen our order book or order throughput affected adversely. We have to keep in mind further that shippers are a large part of the customer base to sign these railroads. Railroads are -- they own fewer cars than shippers and leasing companies combined. And if you cannot take gas as a leasing operation, I guess, in North America (ph) and the world, it -- that's where the action is. So, it affects shippers adversely, PSR does, in some cases and positively in other cases. So, it is a little bit of a complex thing and it varies by railroad -- railroad by railroad and how it's getting implemented, some are doing it very well, some of them -- they are basically just cutting costs and cutting service. And that doesn't sit well with a lot of shippers. Some of the shippers may either go to (ph) OT5s as derivatives allow them and run their own cars, which creates demand or they might go to trucks, or they might go to the STB and complain, which we believe they will do depending on how harsh this environment is, yes. Ken Hoexter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst And just -- I guess on that, the crude order from Alberta, do that will stay in in Canada? Or did some of that come to the manufacturing market in the US? William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors I think, Ken, that some was in Canada and some was in the -- which are awarded to US stockholders. Ken Hoexter -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Okay. Hi, thanks for the time and thoughts. Appreciate it. William A. Furman -- Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman of the Board of Directors Thank you. Justin M.

92,"By H. Adam Holt, CFP, ChFC When advisors and fintech companies talk about the client experience, they usually focus on features and apps like client portals, a paperless account opening process, and other digitized solutions. But in truth, the client experience is about so much more than the web-based tools you can offer to clients. One of the most impactful parts of the client experience can be something as simple as how you schedule your meetings. Have you ever noticed how some professions seem to have figured out how to execute something exceptionally well, while others in the professions around them seem to struggle? I was reminded of this recently when I presented the responses from Asset-Map customers and advisors for our customer journey survey. Two years of surveys and hundreds of responses revealed an alarming trend: there is near-unanimous aggravation around the effort and inconsistencies around the client-advisor meeting scheduling experience. For advisors, the challenge is that few clients and prospects answer their home or cell phone any more, resulting in a barrage of emails and struggle to align times and dates through outdated availability like this: Advisor: “I’m available to do a review meeting on Tuesday at 10am or Friday at noon.” Client (3-days later): “We can do a remote meeting at 12:30.” Advisor (1 day later): “Sorry, that time is now taken. Can we look to next week?” Client: We’re out of town for the next week. When else would work for you?”... For their investors, the accessibility of their advisor is called into question. Often people will think of calling their advisor after the work day is done, which also happens to mean that their advisor is no longer in the office. Since texting is off the table for most advisors, we resort to assistants and emails and simply wait... Interestingly, multiple responses in our customer journey survey indicated that advisors and customers alike recognize dentists as the most effective scheduling profession. When we asked, “Who by analogy is providing the best user experience scheduling?” the response was unanimous. It’s easy to see why dentists have to be so good at scheduling when you take a moment to reflect on their business. To run a healthy dental practice, it is essential that dentists get patients back in the chair for maintenance every six months. They have set the precedent because they know if you miss the next cleaning, you might not come in for years. The financial advice profession is not so different—it’s also vital that advisors maintain regular contact with their clients to stay on top of new developments and changes to financial plans and conditions, whether there’s any pain or not. In the next section, I’ll explain how advisors can mimic what dentists have done to improve scheduling. More than any other profession, dentists have cracked the code of making sure that we show up for our appointments. By making sure we don't leave our current visit before we schedule the next appointment, and then confirming our upcoming appointment a certain number of days before it happens, dental practices ensure a constant pipeline of activity for their practice.  They are booked months in advance and this supports their exclusivity and revenue predictability. As a patient, I am going to book an appointment six months out when I know there is little conflict at the time of day that serves me.  Because it’s already in my calendar, I will schedule around it. Frankly, the guilt of canceling an appointment is probably motivation enough for all of us because we have to call to cancel and reschedule several months out.  Who wants to anger the person who will have a drill in their hand the next time they see you? I believe the financial advice community should approach scheduling in the same way (no, not with a drill). With the number of scheduling software apps available, there is no excuse for financial advisors not to offer clients a convenient, accessible way to schedule meetings. Affordable solutions including Calendly, ScheduleOnce, TimeTrade, and others can all link to an advisor’s calendar, making it simple for existing clients and prospects to see current available times and set a meeting whenever it’s convenient for them. Not only can it handle the rescheduling in most cases, it can also send out confirmations via email and text message with instructions on where the meeting is occurring.  How many times have we all gone to attend a remote meeting and there are no link or conference call details?  Amateur. Even the dentist confirms the time, place and what to bring (teeth, money and your calendar). In our company, the scheduling system is embedded in our CRM, which presents unique links to different sets of stakeholders to allow them to schedule meetings ranging anywhere from fifteen-minute check-ins to two-hour brainstorming meetings. The scheduling system automatically sets reminders, location, and confirmations without any human interaction after the initial time is selected (see what I mean: Schedule a live demo of Asset-Map). Removing the frustration from the meeting process can help advisors get in front of clients on a more regular basis, and both relationships and financial plans will benefit as a result. As we shared in our Three Ways to Promote In-house Innovation video (3:42), listening to your peers can be one of the most effective ways to improve your practice and run a healthier business. We’re sharing the presentation of our Advisor and Customer Journey survey so you can see what other types of strategies you can use to positively affect the entire customer and advisor experience.

93," The companies grouped under the Semiconductor - General category produce a broad range of semiconductor devices serving multiple end markets. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the U.S. is the largest producer of semiconductors with 44% market share. The group estimates that overall semiconductors grew 13.7% in 2018 driven by double digit growth in the automotive, computing, communications, government and industrial markets. There are some major themes shaping the industry- First, being on the building-block side of technology, it will continue to benefit from the proliferation of the Internet and the growing digitization of our lives in the foreseeable future. Second, because of the growth potential in emerging markets, regulatory (and/or political) issues, particularly in places like China, can play an increasingly important role. In this context, the government's positive tone around its ongoing talks with Beijing is encouraging as a deal would mean that trade war concerns can be laid to rest. Semiconductor companies in particular stand to benefit because the Chinese government's drive to build its own industry will require plenty of collaborations with leading semiconductor players. Third, because end devices have to be priced lower to reach more people, the pressure on companies to bring down cost will remain. So companies will find it advantageous to move operations to places where labor may be cheaper or the proximity to manufacturing facilities can lower transportation and other cost. Industry consolidation is also likely to continue as the cost of developing new designs has increased manifold. Fourth, we are likely to see more often is close collaboration with device makers facilitating quicker consumption and better inventory management. Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Limited Returns The  Zacks Semiconductor-General Industry is a stock group within the broader  Zacks Computer and Technology Sector . It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #212, which places it at the bottom 17% of more than 250 Zacks industries. The group's Zacks Industry Rank , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry's earnings estimate for the current year has declined by 1.4%. Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture. Industry Leads on Stock Market Performance The Zacks Semiconductor - General Industry has led the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year. The industry appreciated 7.3% over this period compared to the S&P 500 index's increase of 2.8% and the broader sector's increase of 5.2%. One-Year Price Performance   Industry's Current Valuation On the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing soft semiconductor companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 16.28X, just above the 16.20X median value but below the S&P 500's 17.00X. It is however below the sector's forward-12-month P/E of 19.57X. Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.73X, as low as 12.78X and at the median of 16.03X, as the chart below shows. Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio   Bottom Line This isn't the best place to invest in right now, but prospects are likely to look up as the U.S. comes to an understanding with China and smartphone demand gathers momentum in the back half of the year. So while the more cautious of us might wait for a better entry point, here are some stock picks for the rest: Intel Corp (INTC): This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 14.6% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS remains unchanged in the last 60 days. Price and Consensus: INTC   STMicroelectronics  (STM): The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 20.5% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS moved up a penny in the last 60 days.

94," Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)  released IMDb Freedive in January, a free ad-supported video-on-demand platform available on IMDb.com and Fire TV devices. Now the company is in talks with both media companies and marketers to offer even more ad-supported video for Fire TV customers, according to a Cheddar  report. Amazon is looking to offer both news and entertainment programming. The company will license content from other media companies, according to the report, but it won't include any original content, such as Amazon Prime Video. Amazon's plans pose a significant threat to Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) , which has made significant investments in its Roku Channel since its launch about a year and a half ago. The Roku Channel also offers ad-supported video content, and it recently added premium subscriptions to video-on-demand channels within the app. Amazon is in a better position to win advertising revenue and license better content than Roku, making its devices that much more attractive to consumers.  Image source: Amazon Amazon is already investing billions of dollars in content for Prime Video. It practically has the ability to spend whatever it wants on content for its latest expansion into streaming video. Roku, on the other hand, has just $198 million in cash and short-term investments sitting on its balance sheet. That's a bit less than the $40.5 billion at Amazon's disposal. Both Amazon and Roku have a good idea of what its users are interested in watching, so they can use that data to inform their content licensing decisions. Amazon, however, is better at crunching data to make decisions, such as what products to show shoppers or developing private-label products. That means it might have a better understanding of a piece of content's true value, and it might be willing to pay more for it than Roku as a result. And it certainly has the money to do so. If Amazon's service has more attractive content than the Roku Channel, it could incentivize consumers to buy a Fire TV device. Fire TV is already attractive to Prime members because of Prime Video's integration with the user interface. But Amazon is looking to reach beyond Prime members with its ad-supported service and Fire TV. It could potentially use the devices and ad-supported service as a means of selling consumers on Prime. Roku has done an excellent job building out its advertising technology and targeting capabilities , but Amazon has a $10 billion advertising business. Amazon, which already has a couple of video ad products with its Thursday Night Football broadcasts and Twitch videos, has considerable ad technology and ad buyers in place to compete. Moreover, Amazon has better data to work with than Roku. Amazon knows what its viewers are searching for, strongly considering, and buying online. That's some extremely valuable data for marketers. Better data also makes ads more relevant to viewers. Cat lovers don't want to see advertisements for dog products, and dog lovers definitely don't want to see ads for cat products. Not only does Amazon's superior data enable it to monetize its ad-supported video better than Roku, it makes it more attractive to consumers as well. If Amazon wanted to offer content owners a revenue share in exchange for licensing content, a strategy Roku has taken with the Roku Channel, most would find Amazon's platform more attractive because of its better monetizing capacity. Amazon's plans are to keep its ad-supported streaming content exclusive to Fire TV users, according to Cheddar's report. Roku took a similar approach with the Roku Channel initially, but it has since started branching out to more platforms . Roku's strategy is shifting from hardware sales to a platform business, where it generates money from advertising and revenue shares from the subscriptions it sells. The latest integration of premium subscriptions in the Roku Channel gives it a greater capacity to extend the service to more devices. Amazon, meanwhile, is focused on driving growth in Prime memberships. Fire TV (and most of Amazon's other devices) is designed to work better with Prime. The more Amazon can incentivize customers to buy a Fire TV, the more likely they are to sign up for a Prime account. As such, it's unlikely Amazon will extend its ad-supported video service beyond its own devices. So, if customers want both, they have to hope Roku will work with its biggest competitor. Despite Roku's increasing openness to work with other hardware makers, that's still a long shot. Amazon's ability to invest in content and attract marketers and consumers makes it a serious threat to Roku, and it could force the smaller company to make some very tough decisions.

all of today's research reports here >>> Strong Buy-ranked Boeing 's shares have gained +17.6% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Aerospace & Defense industry, which declined -3.5% during the same time period. The Zacks analyst emphasizes that the company is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world. The company's 20-year market outlook forecasts commercial jetliner demand to increase by 4.1%. Single-aisle jets are expected to be the major driver behind this growth. Boeing expects commercial orders to be fueled by sustained annual growth in commercial passenger traffic along with a big wave of retiring, old planes. Its strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Its revenue exposure is also spread across more than 90 countries around the globe. However, the aerospace giant may face competitive challenges once new manufacturers like China enters the commercial jet space. (You can

). Shares of Lockheed Martin have lost -13.6% in the past year, underperforming the Zacks Aerospace Defense industry, which has declined -3.5% over the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks that since it is the largest defense contractor in the world, Lockheed Martin enjoys a strong demand for its high-end military equipment in domestic as well as international markets. Consequently, robust order growth has been a primary growth driver for this company. The F-35 program continues to be a primary growth driver for the company. Lockheed Martin frequently procures significant contracts that are a major growth driver for its revenues. However it faces intense competition for its broad portfolio of products and services in both domestic and international markets. It remains subject to interest rate risk related to the issuance of debt. (You can

). Buy-ranked Anthem 's shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Insurance industry's rally in the past year (up +26.2% vs. +8.2%). Moreover, it has witnessed its 2019 and 2020 earnings estimates move north over the last 30 days. The Zacks analyst thinks the company's prudent acquisitions complement its organic growth. Its consistently growing topline paves the way for long-term growth. A diverse product portfolio has also helped the company enhance its underwriting results. Anthem's strong capital position backs effective capital deployment via share buybacks and regular dividends. A strong outlook for 2019 instills investor's confidence in the company. However, its declining membership is a persistent concern. Also, the company has been suffering from high benefit costs and rising selling, general and administrative expenses. (You can

Initiatives to reward shareholders also bode well.  Corcept (CORT) Grows Strong on Cushing's Syndrome Drug Korlym Per the Zacks analyst, Corcept's Cushing's syndrome drug Korlym shows high growth potential. The company's efforts to expand the drug's label also hold promise and bodes well for long-term growth.   AbbVie's (ABBV) International Humira Sales Erosion a Concern The Zacks analyst believes that while U.S. Humira and hematological oncology franchise growth will drive sales in 2019, the loss of international Humira revenues to biosimilars will be a big headwind.  Weak Business Solutions Unit Drags Western Union (WU) Per the Zacks analyst, revenues at this segment have remained weak for the past many years, due to weakness in its U.K business.

97," I have to admit that I had not expected the tenth anniversary of this bull market to have come and gone without much fanfare. Yes, there was a celebration -- after all, the 10-year bull market is the longest since World War II, and the S&P 500 is up more than 300% -- but it wasn't as omnipresent as I had anticipated. Instead, investors have been reveling in another, albeit related milestone -- the market recovery from the fourth-quarter 2018 selloff in the strongest three-month performance since the third quarter of 2009. This strength has helped the market to recover much of the fourth-quarter losses and, as a result, post strong positive year-over-year returns. Nearly every corner of the market has turned a strong performance over the past year. The market, as represented by the S&P 500, is up 7.3% year-over-year -- helped, without a doubt, by the first-quarter rally. But even as every single market sector turned out a positive performance in the first quarter of 2019, some -- such as energy, materials and financials -- are still down compared with a year ago. Let's look under the hood of one of the sectors to see which well-known stocks are powering the performance. Many of you may be thinking I'm referring to the technology sector, since I'm the Chief Investment Strategist for Fast-Track Millionaire . After all, many of the stocks we feature naturally tend to come from this sector. But I'm not talking about technology this time. Instead, I invite you to get to know the newly named and arranged ""communication services"" sector. The New High-Growth Sector You Need To Know
Up 4% year-over-year and nearly 14% in the latest quarter, this is no longer the home of just the high-yielding, slow-growing telecom stocks -- the likes of AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). If you are a growth investor looking for new ideas, or if you are considering a growth-oriented exchange-traded fund (ETF) for a portion of your portfolio, you can no longer disregard this sector (and if you are an income investor, pay attention as well): last September, the indexing companies announced a major change to the way they treat this formerly stodgy fraternity. The result was an expanded telecommunication services sector, including several companies from the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors. If you think Alphabet, the parent company of Google (Nasdaq: GOOGL ), is a technology company, you might be right. But it's not in the technology sector, not officially, at least. As of September 21, 2018, Google became a charter member of the ""communication services"" sector, right along with Facebook (Nasdaq: FB ) and Twitter (Nasdaq: TWTR ). Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX ), too, is now a part of this sector now, together with a host of more traditional media companies such as CBS (NYSE: CBS ) and Disney (NYSE: DIS ). Technology-driven, these game-changing companies have had a profound impact not just on their businesses or sectors, but the entire economy. This is what we want from our portfolio holdings over at Fast-Track Millionaire, current and future -- a promise of lasting, high-growth, boundary-shattering impact. They may not all officially be classified as ""technology"" -- as long as they carry the promise of big-time returns to our portfolio, I will be perfectly fine with whatever they're called. But for now, back to the future: does this overall rebound have legs? Is it still safe to dip your toe in the water? In a word, yes. And we'll be ready to dive in as opportunities arise. Action To Take
I believe that this market has further room to run. It didn't just rebound on a whim. Stocks have been propelled higher by expectations that the monetary authorities -- the U.S. Federal Reserve -- have ended the nearly four-year streak of interest-rate increases. And the markets are now considering the possibility that the Fed might even cut interest rates, if it comes to that, making money cheaper, savings and other low-risk investments (like bonds) relatively less attractive and stocks -- again -- an attractive proposition. In such an environment, bad news can accidentally become good news again. The market might overlook an occasional lagging economic indicator or a profit warning from a bellwether company or two -- as long as those data readings don't fall too far off behind or the profit warnings are not too dire. And if they set the stage for a buying opportunity, so much the better. Still, we'll need to be on guard -- especially with the market just a couple of percentage points off its all-time highs. Taking a strategic gain or two in such an environment could also be a good idea. ",24.17999999999938,1
98,"(Updates with the price move, EIA/Well Fargo reports and general market commentary from the first paragraph.) Crude rose on Friday, trading at its highest level since November, lifted by a strong US monthly jobs report, which undermined bears who were expecting a slowdown in oil demand because of an economic crisis signaled earlier this month by the bond market. West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ), which started 2019 at $45, jumped by 1.3% intraday to $62.91, the highest level since $63.10 in November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brent futures also climbed above the psychological $70 mark, gaining 1.1% intraday. Oil, which was down early on Friday, rose after job creation in the US rebounded strongly in March, tempering views that demand for oil will slow in the months ahead because of fears of an economic downturn. Data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed on Friday non-farm payrolls expanded by 196,000, compared with a market estimate for an increase of 175,000. The unemployment rate stood at 3.8%. Oil prices have surged by more than 30% so far in 2019 as production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC members led by Russia, which together have cut 1.2 million barrels per day since the beginning of this year, have helped stabilize the demand-supply balance. The compliance rate for this joint cut has been uncharacteristically high, about 90%, and that's partly involuntary because of political crises in oil-producing countries such as Venezuela and Libya, as well as the US sanctions on Iran, the third biggest oil producer in OPEC. Oil prices are ending this week higher even as the Energy Infomation Administration reported Wednesday crude stockpiles surged by 7.2 million barrels over a week to March 29, which is in contrast with expectations for a drop of 425,000 barrels in a Reuters' poll of analysts. The rally in oil prices has been ""impressive, and quick,"" according to a report from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""So quick, in fact, that our $65 year-end 2019 price target could be challenged soon,"" John LaForge, the head of real asset strategy, wrote in the report. LaForge, however, noted higher oil prices will drive extra US production in the coming months. He said the next short-term oil price may move may be down. The number of oil rigs operating in the US increased for the first time in seven weeks, jumping by 15 to 831, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes ( BHGE ), which tracked the seven-day period ending April 4. The combined oil and gas rig count in the US rose by 19 to 1,025 as gas rigs increased by four to 194. In Canada, the number of oil rigs in operation slumped by 13 to 22 over the same period, while the number of gas rigs was down by seven to 46. As a result, the North American total slid by one to 1,093 versus 1,114 a year ago, the data showed. Later in the year, LaForge of Wells Fargo added, WTI futures ""will make a run at $65 as geopolitical tensions heat up among oil-related countries.""",24.17999999999938,1
99,"Seven environmental and human rights organizations have launched a lawsuit against Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) in a bid to cut the company's reliance on fossil fuels and to spur its reportedly inadequate efforts to address climate change, according to media reports on Friday. The lawsuit was filed by Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, ActionAid, and 17,000 people who have signed up as co-plaintiffs. A Court summons was handed to Shell at its headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands. The groups are demanding Shell to stop extracting oil and gas, and to slash its greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. They are also calling for Shell to align its goals with the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit global warning to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Shell has about six weeks to reply to the court summons, after which a judge will decide on further proceedings. The company, however, believes that the case should not be brought to court as it supports the Paris agreement and it has promised to cut its greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050.",24.17999999999938,1

106," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A real estate investment trust (REIT) is dedicated first to income. It is required to send 90% of earnings back to investors in the form of dividends . This means it's unusual to find a REIT that also offers capital gains. But I've found just such a place. Data Center REITs offer hosting, colocation and cloud on-ramps to enterprises and Internet Service Providers. They act as a sort of glue among the Cloud Czars, like Amazon  (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
). If you do a Google search for something and then buy it on Amazon, the request and response likely went through a data center REIT. The data centers hosted by REITs aren't all cloud-based, but they usually require connections to clouds, and this is the best way to get them. The colocation market alone continues to grow at 10% each year , driven by the needs of the Cloud Czars, according to Synergy Research. This was a $34 billion market last year. It's part of a larger trend in which the Cloud Czars are taking over the telecommunications market . If your portfolio seeks both income and capital gains, here's where you can find them in data center REITs.   Equinix (NASDAQ:
EQIX
) was founded in Redwood City, California in 1998 and has focused on global services almost since its inception. It has a market cap of $39 billion, and last year delivered $9.84 per share in dividends to its shareholders. To a current buyer that's a yield of just 2.16%. But five years ago, the stock was trading at $172 per share. It was trading April 4 at $465. If you bought some shares five years ago, the current dividend would give you a yield of 5.75%. Plus, there's that capital gain, almost 30% per year, doubling what you would have gotten from the average NASDAQ stock. This is key to successful income investing. Don't just focus on the current yield. Let time work for you. If you're on the right side of a trend, you are almost certain to prosper. Last year, Equinix had revenue of $5.09 billion, up from $2.44 billion in 2014, and it brought $365 million of that to the bottom line. The asset base has more than doubled, to $20.24 billion, and while there is $9.44 billion in debt on those assets, the debt-to-asset ratio has been improving. Equinix continues to grow its international footprint, most recently with a new Australian center.  Its DC1 building in Virginia was the first large greenfield center to open, 20 years ago, back when such centers were mainly selling themselves as a way for corporations to speed data flows for things like video conferencing, or as alternatives to the Network Access Points (NAPs) that then dominated internet switching. Equinix is not a huge acquirer, its most recent buy being Metronode in 2017.  But that means that other companies' shareholders aren't getting a big chunk of your gains and that the stock isn't being watered down with new shares. All this makes Equinix one of the best data center REITs to buy.   Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:
DLR
) was formed as a public company in 2004 out of 21 data centers acquired out of bankruptcy by GI Partners, a private equity firm. It now has 214 centers with 34.5 million square feet of rentable space in the U.S. and Europe. On April 4, it had a market cap of $26.75 billion, and last year delivered $4.32 per share in dividends to investors. That's a yield of 3.55%. Add a 19% one-year gain in the stock price and you get a total return of about 22%. Over the last five years, the stock is up 137%, and if you bought in 2014, when the price of the stock was about $60 per share, your current yield is about 7.2%. In 2018, Digital Realty had revenue of slightly over $3 billion, with net income of $341 million, meaning 11% of revenues became net income. The company's assets are worth over $23.7 billion, with $11.1 billion in debt, a slight improvement over 2014. Operating cash flow has also doubled. The company's biggest deal came in 2017, a $7.8 billion agreement to buy DuPont Fabros Technology. But the company quickly came back for more, buying Ascently, based in Brazil, last year for $1.8 billion. The company also broke ground last month for its third center in Singapore. Brad Thomas of iREIT Investor notes that, while Digital Realty is an aggressive acquirer of data centers, it doesn't account for acquisitions aggressively, which means it's not stressing its balance sheet at the expense of the long term. Thomas calls Digital Realty's global footprint a big advantage, and its size let it carry $236 million of empty land in fast-growing northern Virginia on its balance sheet. Thirteen of the 25 analysts currently following DLR have it on their buy lists.   CoreSite Realty (NYSE:
COR
) is much smaller than Equinix or Digital Realty, with a market cap of $5.3 billion. CoreSite was born from two ""telecom hotels,"" as they were called then, in 2001, in San Francisco. It was then called CRG West, and the location was where Internet Service Providers hooked into phone networks, and where enterprises could go for big bandwidth. CoreSite went public in 2009, and then began expanding internationally, starting in London. Its early expansion was funded by the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. They reduced their interest to about 29% in 2016. The small size of CoreSite Realty, relative to Digital Realty and Equinix, does give it some big advantages, in the form of capital gains. The shares are up 261% in the last five years, while dividends have tripled from 36 cents per share in 2014 to $1.10 now. That dividend yields a fat 4.4%. CoreSite is the right stock for you if you're mainly looking for exposure to the U.S. internet market. It is, like the other REITs, a great long-term holding. It's expected to raise the dividend again, to $1.29 per share, in May.  It bills itself as offering ""hybrid cloud solutions,"" with its close connections to big clouds like Amazon and Microsoft, and colocation services for enterprises building their own cloud systems.   Smaller market caps can deliver big gains, as CoreSite shows, but there are downsides. A strategic shift can take a stock down hard. QTS Realty Trust (NYSE:
QTS
) made that kind of shift in 2017, moving from managed services to being a ""cloud on-ramp."" The company insisted the new plan would mean big new opportunities, but these have taken time to develop, with repeated misses on earnings estimates taking a toll on the stock. QTS began life in Kansas, in 2003, expanded into Atlanta through a 2005 acquisition, and now has 25 data centers with 5.7 million square feet of rentable space. QTS went public in 2013 and has since doubled in price, while the dividend has also doubled to its current 44 cents. That represented a yield of 3.93% on April 4, and the company's market cap stood at $2.83%. QTS's earnings misses have the stock trading at just 7 times revenue, and if it does beat estimates when it reports in May, it could shoot up. Analysts are expecting 54 cents per share, after losing 2 cents per share in the last quarter. All this makes QTS the most speculative of the data center REITs. There are opportunities here, both in the success of its strategy shift and its continuing weakness, which could make it a prize for a larger company. A single transaction can transform an investor's play from the weakest stock on the block to a big stake in one of the strongest.   Like QTS Realty Trust, CyrusOne (NASDAQ:
CONE
) is an underperforming company that is said to be attractive to acquirers. But unlike QTS, where the weakness comes from its own strategic shifts, with CyrusOne the weakness comes from its history of being privately held. CyrusOne wasn't publicly traded until 2013. Founded in 2001, it was bought by private equity players ABRY Partners in 2007 and then by Cincinnati Bell, a small phone company, in 2010. It went public in 2013 and by 2015 Cincinnati Bell had sold out its stake. The company today has 45 data centers, mostly in the U.S., but it also has operations in Europe and Singapore. It expanded into Europe through the 2018 acquisition of Zenium for $442 million. CyrusOne stock has been weak since last September, falling 21% since issuing what was considered weak earnings guidance, $3.10 per share instead of the $3.50 expected. Because REITs must pay out 90% of earnings as dividends, this meant a significant dividend shortfall. A business that began with small warehouses in central cities, where phone exchanges interconnected, is now built on finding big parcels of empty land near where cloud giants intend to build. A modern data REIT must acquire land and build ahead of demand, competing with other REITs, private equity companies trying to build new REITs from scratch and the cloud owners themselves. It's the weakness of results, a dividend of 46 cents per share yielding 3.51%, that drove CyrusOne down. But it's that same weakness that now has some speculators betting it will be acquired, which keeps the price of the stock up. That's the way it is in the data center REIT business, where the only constant is growth and the clouds rule. Dana Blankenhornis a financial and technology journalist.

107," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investors have plenty more to like about Tandem Diabetes (NASDAQ:
TNDM
) stock after the company reported its fiscal-fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26.  TNDM stock reached $74.81 last month and is now trading around $62. Those who missed the run-up of TNDM may want to examine the company's recent earnings to  determine how much more Tandem stock can rise.  TNDM earned 2 cents per share of Tandem stock, as its revenue jumped 132.3%  to $3.7 million. Its operating margin came in at  1%, the first time that metric has been positive, signaling that it will be profitable in the intermediate term. TNDM grew thanks to the successful launch of Basal-IQ. According to diaTribe , Basal IQ is an ""algorithm"" which ""stops basal insulin delivery when low blood sugar is predicted (within 30 minutes) and resumes insulin delivery once blood sugar levels start to rise."" TNDM successfully transitioned Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:
JNJ
) customers to its product. For the year, TNDM's revenue grew to $184 million, up over 70% from 2017. Never has Tandem grown this fast on an annual basis. Looking ahead, Tandem forecast 2019 sales of $255 million - $270 million and  break-even EPS. It expects its gross margin to be around 52% in full-year 2019. In the very competitive industry of medical electronics, TNDM is doing very well. The company transitioned successfully from a domestic-focused startup to a global diabetes-technology company. Given the strong momentum it's expected to have this year, TNDM may become a big global player. Management is unsure of its pricing strategy for its automated insulin delivery system, Control-IQ. The company has a priority of securing reimbursement for the product from health-insurance companies. TNDM has added strong executives to its leadership team. Rick Valencia, the President of Qualcomm Life, joined Tandem's board last year. In Q1, Becky Robertson also joined its board, bringing her proven track record of helping medical-device companies. She also has a great deal of experience as an engineer, entrepreneur, corporate executive, and board member. Manuel Jaime became Senior VP of Technology and Digital Health. He brings expertise in mobile connectivity and cloud technology.  The FDA's approval of Tandem's T:slim X2, an ACE or alternate controller-enabled infusion pump, which features a touch screen and has the ability to receive feature updates remotely,  greatly widens Tandem's lead over other medical-devices firms. Not only will remote delivery lower operating costs, but customers will enjoy the ease of upgrading their devices. The results speak for themselves: shipments of the device grew by over 100% last year. And what is more impressive is that TNDM has no debt and has positive-operating-cash flow. Tandem is positioned for another strong year. It has a differentiated pump platform, an automated insulin delivery program, and will expand internationally this year. Surveys already show that Tandem's customers are more satisfied than those who have bought insulin pumps made by other manufacturers. Design testing of Tandem's t:sport insulin pump, which is half the size of the t:slim and has a mobile control, will be mostly completed this year. Once the device receives ACE pump classification in the second half of the year, it will be submitted for CE marking in 2020. TNDM is scheduled to launch its first-ever mobile app in the first half of this year.  Since it will be offered on both major platforms, Apple and Android, the app should increase customers' satisfaction. It will also give healthcare providers easier access to pump and blood glucose data. Analysts are highly bullish on TNDM stock, according to Tipranks .  But that has mixed implications for TNDM stock, since, if too many mainstream investors buy Tandem stock, its valuations will become stretched. But on the other hand, the fact that Wall Street has few red flags on Tandem stock is positive for TNDM. Tandem stock has paused after rallying strongly in March. TNDM stock could continue to be profitable for investors as the company carries out its growth plans. As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

108,"   The crypto payment platform Bitrefill has announced an upgrade to its Thor service. The upgrade is dubbed ""Thor Turbo,"" and its expected to speed up the process of connecting to Bitrefill's Lightning node, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine . Bitrefill launched the Thor service in January 2019 as an on-demand Lightning channel service that allows users to receive payments whether they have bitcoin loaded into their Lightning wallets or not. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine via email, Bitrefill COO John Carvalho said that, since Thor launched, the startup has opened hundreds of Lightning channels with customers and hopes to soon reach the thousands. But, with the original version of Thor, it takes roughly ""six confirmations before a new Lightning channel is usable"" and roughly 60 minutes of waiting time, according to the release. With Thor Turbo, Bitrefill expects the process to go much faster. The startup claimed that users can ""instantly hop onto the network and make purchases from anywhere in the world without delay."" Beyond the time savings, Thor Turbo users can also choose to have their channel pre-loaded with a spendable bitcoin balance. For those who don't have Bitcoin in their wallets, Thor Turbo has a feature that converts other cryptocurrencies into spendable bitcoin on the Lightning Network. Currently, it supports ether, dash, litecoin and dogecoin conversions. Per the release, Thor Turbo will be an optional upgrade to users and Bitrefill will continue to provide support for non-Turbo Thor channels. Carvalho said Turbo channels would cost as much as non-Turbo channels but that the fees for the original Thor service have been reduced. Adoption of the Lightning Network has grown tremendously since it was first introduced. As of press time, the network supports a total of 7,816 nodes with a collective network capacity of 1,076.03 BTC (worth about $5.35 million). ""We're aiming to release several more Lightning-based services this year, demonstrating how businesses can make money and support Bitcoin infrastructure at the same time,"" Carvalho concluded.",24.17999999999938,1
109,"   As part of an ongoing criminal case, a judge in Canada has ordered that a local online drug dealer must forfeit about 281.41 bitcoin (worth about $1.4 million) after it was found that he used the cryptocurrency to fund his illegal activities. It's been reported as Canada's largest-ever bitcoin forfeiture. In 2015, local authorities seized the dealer's laptop and the BTC tokens (worth about $65,885 at the time) were found, according to a report by the Toronto Star . The dealer, Matthew Phan, pleaded guilty to the charges of possessing illegal substances, including ketamine, cocaine and PCP, and attempting to import a gun, in December 2018. At a forfeiture hearing last month, Phan begged the court to allow him to keep half of the cryptocurrencies discovered, saying that he didn't use all of them for illegal purposes. ""Phan, who fought the forfeiture, argued not all of the bitcoins were used for nefarious purposes and that some were used to buy and sell gold,"" per the report. ""As well, he claimed he was selling the cryptocurrency itself on various exchanges."" In the ruling, Superior Court Justice Jane Kelly remarked that while she didn't doubt Phan was a legitimate crypto trader, it was difficult for her to believe his explanation for why he had so much bitcoin in his possession. ""There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that Mr. Phan was using the dark markets to purchase illegal items such as firearms and silencers,"" Kelly said in her statement. ""It is clear from the evidence found during searches, particularly of his condominium unit, that he was conducting a large sales operation of illegal narcotics."" However, in line with her belief that not all his assets were intended for criminal purposes, the judge allowed Phan to keep 7.23 BTC (worth about $36,371).",24.17999999999938,1
110," By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - The flagship of the Trump administration's advanced nuclear power research program could cost up to 40 percent more than a government official estimated earlier this year, a U.S. Department of Energy document shows. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has tried to breathe life into the country's nuclear power industry, which is suffering in the face of competition from plants burning cheap natural gas as well as falling costs for wind and solar power. The VTR would let U.S. companies conduct advanced technology and fuels tests without having to go to competitors in Russia and China, Perry said. Meant to be built by late 2025, it would be the first new nuclear test reactor built by the Energy Department, or DOE, in many decades. Perry did not put a price on the reactor, which would be led by the department's Idaho National Laboratory. But an internal DOE document dated Jan. 22, obtained by public policy group the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) through a freedom of information request, puts the estimated cost for construction and starting the VTR at $3.9 billion to $6 billion. The costs in the document, seen by Reuters on Thursday, had not been reported previously. The high end of that range is about 40 percent more than an estimate by Kemal Pasamehmetoglu, the head of the Idaho National Laboratory's VTR program, who was quoted in the Morning Consult news outlet in February saying it would cost up to $3.5 billion in today's dollars. The calculation of the jump in the cost is affected by the Energy Department's estimate which included cost escalations of up to 3.8 percent annually. The UCS estimated that VTR's cost for the next seven years would be about $550 million to $850 million annually, compared to the $740 million appropriated in the fiscal year 2019 budget for the department's entire advanced nuclear technology development, which contained just $65 million for VTR. An Energy Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Pasamehmetoglu's gauge of VTR's cost has been his personal opinion, not an official department estimate. The department's preliminary cost estimate for VTR has long been $3 billion to $6 billion, the official said. If successful, the VTR is meant to lead to a new wave of so-called fast reactors, reviving nuclear power companies. Fast reactors breed their own fuel, unlike today's fleet of light water reactors. They also have a safety benefit of allowing a plant to operate under low pressure conditions. But critics worry that the fuel cycle of fast reactors will likely depend on the reprocessing or recycling of plutonium or uranium, both of which can be used as fissile materials for nuclear weapons. ""Fast reactors are less safe, less secure, and more proliferation-prone than light-water reactors,"" said Ed Lyman, a senior scientist at UCS. ""The DOE should not be asking taxpayers to spend billions on this dangerous reactor."" Lyman also said cheaper approaches for testing to support fast reactor development could be done at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the DOE-sponsored research and development center in Tennessee. VTR has already led to business for nuclear companies. In November, the Idaho lab said it had contracted GE Hitachi Nuclear, a venture between General Electric Co and Hitachi Ltd, to support the conceptual design and safety activities for an unspecified amount.

111," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks . Earnings season is getting closer, but there's still one thin week left on the earnings calendar. After that, however, first-quarter earnings reports will start rolling in … and a market trading at six-month highs will face a test. In 2019, it's been so far, so good. The S&P 500 Index has gained 14.5%, and all-time highs are only a 2% gain away. Strong first-quarter earnings reports from key components should be enough to get the market over the hump. In the meantime, there are a few reports to keep an eye on next week. A major airline should deliver good news about the consumer and its industry. A recent IPO gives its first earnings report, and the reaction to that release could highlight investor sentiment as several private giants look to come public. And two big banks kick off earnings season on Friday. The big earnings reports aren't on the way quite yet, but next week could provide a bit of a preview.   Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, April 9, after market close Denim maker Levi Strauss (NYSE:
LEVI
) only went public a few weeks ago. On Tuesday, it releases its first quarterly earnings report since going private back in 1985. It's unlikely that the numbers will lead to a huge move in LEVI stock. Figures from the IPO prospectus show business has been rather stable. Adjusted EBITDA actually declined between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2017 (ending November) before rallying strongly in FY18. Early trading, too, has been rather quiet, with LEVI opening up strongly from its $17 IPO price and then moving mostly sideways since. Still, Tuesday's report is worth watching. A public Levi Strauss now gives a barometer for the overall health of denim - a key data point for retailers as varied as American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:
AEO
) and Lululemon Athletica (NYSE:
LULU
), the latter of whom has challenged denim sales . Meanwhile, trading in LEVI might highlight just how investors feel about the big slate of 2019 IPOs. Levi Strauss obviously isn't Lyft (NASDAQ:
LYFT
) or Uber or Airbnb , but early trading in LEVI might highlight some of the dynamics in the post-IPO market - information that could be useful to investors elsewhere.   Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, April 10, before market open Q1 earnings from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:
DAL
) on Wednesday morning might be a bit anti-climactic. Delta already has released preliminary figures for the quarter - which spiked DAL stock earlier this week. A new credit card deal with American Express (NYSE:
AXP
) has further fueled the rally. But there still is a lot of information to be gleaned from the post-earnings conference call. Where does Delta see fuel prices - and oil prices - headed? How is the U.S. consumer reacting in what historically has been a high-dollar, enormous cyclical business? And have other airlines finally stopped the destructive cycle of price wars? At the moment, the news seems reasonably good. But if a strong quarter from Delta kicks off a solid round of earnings reports from other airline stocks, the entire sector could get a lift. U.S. airline stocks haven't performed well since the beginning of 2018. Delta earnings could be the first step toward changing that.   Earnings Report Date: Friday, April 12, before market open The first major reports on the Q1 earnings calendar, however, don't arrive until Friday, when both JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:
JPM
) and rival Wells Fargo (NYSE:
WFC
) deliver earnings reports. From an individual stock standpoint, WFC's earnings likely are more important. Its CEO is departing . The company's ""fake accounts"" scandal still hovers over its reputation. Wells Fargo needs to bounce back, and it needs a strong quarter to show that it has bounced back. But those issues also make JPMorgan Chase earnings of more interest to outside investors. JPM is executing exceptionally well, one reason it's one of my top picks in the big bank space along with Bank of America (NYSE:
BAC
). And so its results should be a ""cleaner"" representation of the health of the U.S. consumer and the effect of lower interest rates on the financial sector. As far as JPM stock goes, I wouldn't expect much in the way of movement: even earnings beats haven't moved JPM stock much of late. But as the opening salvo of the meaty part of the earnings calendar, JPMorgan Chase earnings should help set the tone. A big quarter from JPM will lead investors to see other U.S. reports in a favorable light. But any signs of trouble, combined with modestly worrisome economic data recently reported elsewhere, might lead the market to get jittery at the worst possible time. As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned. The post 3 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week appeared first on InvestorPlace . ",24.17999999999938,1
112," By David French NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Pipeline operator TransCanada Corp is exploring a potential sale of its Columbia Midstream unit in a deal that could value the business at about $1 billion, three sources aware of the matter said on Friday. TransCanada, based in Calgary, Alberta, is offloading parts of its infrastructure to help finance the $8 billion it has earmarked to spend on new projects in 2019, such as the high-profile Coastal GasLink system and the Keystone XL pipeline, which are likely to generate higher returns than these legacy assets. A spokesman for TransCanada declined to comment. Columbia Midstream's assets include four gathering systems and a pipeline in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, according to the company's website. The unit generates around $100 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization annually (EBITDA), and could be valued at a multiple of 10 times that amount, the three sources said. Private equity firms, infrastructure and pension funds have all viewed pipeline assets as attractive acquisitions because of their steady financial returns. TransCanada is working with an investment bank to assist it in the sale process. TransCanada is also selling a package of mineral rights in the same area, located in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States, which would raise further cash for the company, one of the sources said. Mineral rights grant the holder the ability to extract hydrocarbons from certain acreage, although the title to that land is held by another party. The mineral rights could be sold to the same buyer as the midstream unit, but if the company receives a better offer from another party, they could be sold separately, the source said. TransCanada's chief financial officer, Donald Marchand, said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in February that the company could divest assets that generate $500 million of EBITDA without identifying what they were.

113," UNITED NATIONS, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will address the United Nations Security Council next week on Venezuela, a White House official said on Friday, as the 15-member body remains deadlocked over how to deal with the country's political and humanitarian crisis. The United States has sought United Nations support for its backing of opposition leader Juan Guaido as the rightful president of Venezuela. Most Western nations have recognized Guaido as head of state, while Russia and China have stood by socialist President Nicolas Maduro. ""Given the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, we believe a briefing is necessary and timely,"" the U.S. mission to the United Nations wrote in a request, seen by Reuters, for a meeting next week. Pence's address will shine a global spotlight on the issue, but action by the Security Council is unlikely. The United States and Russia both failed in rival bids to get the body to adopt resolutions on Venezuela in February. The United Nations estimates about a quarter of Venezuelans are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to an internal U.N. report seen by Reuters last week, that paints a dire picture of millions of people lacking food and basic services. Maduro has said there is no crisis and blames U.S. sanctions for the country's economic problems. In February Venezuelan government troops blocked U.S.-backed aid convoys entering from Colombia and Brazil. Maduro has accepted aid from ally Russia. Moscow has also provided military assistance to Maduro's government. The White House warned Moscow and other countries backing Maduro against sending troops and military equipment, saying the United States would view such actions as a ""direct threat"" to the region's security. Russia has dismissed U.S. criticism of its military cooperation with Caracas, saying it is not interfering in the Latin American country's internal affairs and poses no threat to regional stability. Guaido invoked the Venezuelan constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate. ",24.17999999999938,1
114,"Sustaining at the higher vicinity near 97 levels, the USD Index that computes the greenback against the six major rival currencies started on the Friday Asian Session with a slip of around ten pips. The slight fall in the index does account to the above-consensus German Industrial reports released in the same time frame. As the Euro got overweighed against the greenback, the entire balance of the USD loosened. The index, however, generated some sound momentum in the European session escalating from 97.20 level touching 97.28 level in the middle of positive US-Sino trade developments. Reports published that the trade talks are imminent to end soon and a trade deal will get signed between the two Superpowers. The most awaited US March Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) and March Average Hourly MoM Earnings came out at 12:30 GMT. The former surprised the market after publishing figures of 196K which are above the market expectation of 180K. The USD Index accelerated upwards drastically reaching 97.39 level from the support line of 97.22. However, the USD Index faced some simultaneous pullbacks too when the Average Hourly numbers missed the consensus estimate. During the Asian session, the euro pair went up slightly after the release of higher than expected German February MoM Industrial Production. The consensus estimated the Industrial figures to come around 0.5 percent while the actual numbers reported 0.2 percent above the market expectation. Gains started shedding off after the release of the mixed US monthly job reports. EUR/USD thereon remained capped near 1.1238/40 resistance levels. At 17:30 GMT, the pair was trading at 1.1214 level. The Loonie pair opened up today near 1.3366 levels. The USD/CAD had created fresh day high near 1.3395 levels after the release of mixed Feb reports consisting of the US NFP and Average Hourly Earnings Reports. The pair showed an additional slight upward push after the release of poor Canadian March Net MoM Change in Employment figures. The cable had a small jump from 1.3079 to 1.3122 level at the start of Friday morning. Later the day, the pair never saw north properly. GBP/USD kept plunging throughout the day underpinned multiple rationales. One of them was, of course, the strengthening of the US Dollar Index amid positive US March NFP reports. Another pain that still keeps disturbing the cable was the Brexit chaos. GBP/USD had reached near fresh lows of  1.2990 levels. Latest news suggests a higher possibility of a ""Flexible"" Brexit extension on May's request for a short delay. The Yen pair kicked off the day with a robust green candlestick at 111.67/77 after US-Sino trade developments. Later in the Asian session, the Cabinet Office released the February Japanese Leading Economic Index which reported higher than the consensus. In the same period, February Japanese Coincident Index reported 98.8 points, 0.71 percent up to the previous 98.1 points. This positive release got discounted in the USD/JPY with a slump of 0.08 percent. The pair made fresh daily high at 12:30 GMT after the release of positive US Non-Farm Payroll reports. These reports elevated the greenback, thereby uplifting the USD/JPY. The pair had reached from 111.59 to 111.81 levels. This article was originally posted on FX Empire",24.17999999999938,1
115," BUENOS AIRES, April 5 (Reuters) - Argentina's peso weakened 1.32 percent to touch a record low of 44.0 per U.S. dollar, traders said on Friday, as political and economic uncertainty put pressure on the local currency. The peso later regained some strength, but nonetheless ended the day at an all-time low close of 43.97 to the greenback. Recession and high inflation dog the government of President Mauricio Macri, a favorite among investors for his free-market policies, and he is losing popularity ahead of his October re-election bid. Argentina will face financing needs of $27.3 billion next year, according to data published on Friday by the treasury, up from its previous estimate of $25.9 billion. The data showed that peso-denominated debt issuance was seen at $17.8 billion next year, up from a previous forecast of $16.1 billion. ",24.17999999999938,1
116," NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday ordered Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to meet for at least an hour to try to settle the agency's concerns over the billionaire entrepreneur's use of Twitter. The SEC had asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet in which the agency said he had improperly posted material information about Tesla's vehicle production outlook without first seeking approval from its lawyers. In an order on Friday, the judge gave both sides until April 18 to reach a resolution. If they do not, the judge said she would decide whether to hold Musk in contempt. If he is held in contempt, the judge will allow the parties to weigh in on possible sanctions. When the SEC initially sued Musk in September, it had asked for his removal. The two sides settled in October, with Musk agreeing to step down as Tesla's chairman. The agreement also called for pre-approval of Musk's written communications that could be material to the company. At a court hearing on Thursday, the SEC suggested that greater oversight of Musk's communications, including the threat of new fines if he backslides, would be an adequate remedy. ""This was a warning. I don't think he gets a second warning,"" said Marc Leaf, a former SEC lawyer in New York. In a statement on Thursday, Musk stood by his actions. ""I have great respect for Judge Nathan, and I'm pleased with her decision today. The tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement,"" he said in the statement released by Tesla. The October settlement resolved a lawsuit over a tweet last Aug. 7 in which Musk said he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The Feb. 19 tweet said: ""Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,"" meaning 500,000 vehicles.Four hours later Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would be ""probably around"" 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling about 400,000. The SEC said the first of the Feb. 19 tweets conflicted with Tesla's Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year. At the time the SEC also said that Musk had violated their agreement by sending a tweet that had not been vetted by Tesla's lawyers and he should be held in contempt. It did not say what penalties it wanted imposed, raising the question of whether it would again seek his removal or propose lesser measures. Musk's lawyers countered that the first Feb. 19 tweet contained nothing new, and that the SEC had conceded during settlement talks that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla.

117," BOGOTA, April 5 (Reuters) - Nearly $50 million in government aid for Colombia's struggling coffee farmers is not enough to keep producers afloat amid a global price crisis, the country's growers' federation said on Friday. Coffee prices on the New York market have hovered at or below $1 per pound so far in 2019 and hit a fresh 13-year low this week as output surpasses demand on the global market. The Colombian coffee federation has repeatedly asked for aid for farmers, including subsidies, debt relief and help with fertilizer costs. But that figure is not enough to help some 540,000 families who make their living from coffee, the federation's council of directors said in a statement. The statement did not say how much the federation would ideally want for growers. ""Given the magnitude of the crisis caused by the sharp fall in international prices, the resources handed over by the government are insufficient,"" the federation said. The government has agreed to give subsidies of up to 30,000 pesos per 125 kg (275 lb) shipment of coffee when the domestic price falls below 715,000 pesos per shipment. The internal price per shipment was 692,000 pesos on Thursday. The subsidy parameters ""absolutely do not acknowledge the reality of the sector,"" the federation said. Production costs per shipment are about 782,000 pesos, 90,000 pesos above what farmers earn on the domestic market, it said. The federation will distribute the aid under the conditions set by the government, but will continue to advocate urgently for higher subsidies and debt relief for farmers. ""(The federation) will continue to use all institutional routes to ensure that the national government thoroughly understands and supports coffee-growers in an effective way amid this difficult situation."" The federation said in February it would discuss a possible unlinking from the New York benchmark price with other producers of high-quality arabica and buyers in an effort to sell coffee above production costs. Exporters and importers say such a move could send buyers looking for other producers. The Agriculture Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

120,"""No problem at all."" That's exactly what the young man on the phone at the bank said to me after I thanked him for not being able to answer my question. He didn't say, ""I'm sorry I wasn't able to be of more assistance,"" or ""I'll be happy to take a message."" Instead, he slouched into the verbal scourge of the 21st-century marketplace: when an employee serving a customer says, ""No problem."" In addition to the sound being harmonically dissonant to a customer's ear, ""No problem"" is also cognitively dissonant to the Universe because of its misuse in the following two service scenarios, both of which are inappropriate and unprofessional: 1. While conducting a business transaction with a customer, any employee introduces the word ""problem"" into the conversation when, until that moment, there wasn't one! Should customers be concerned that their presence at a $$$$, tablecloth restaurant creates some issue, concern or trouble? Has this waiter, whose tip alone could be as much as a week's groceries, been rudely inconvenienced in some way?  ""No problem"" spoils the most beautiful marketplace moment when both customer and business are happiest: consummating a successful business transaction. 2. In the remediation of a customer concern, like returning a defective product, inquiring about an incorrect bill, or the Vichyssoise is served piping hot, an employee says, incredibly, ""No problem."" Of course, by definition, this is technically inaccurate and professionally incompetent because - THERE REALLY IS A PROBLEM! If you ask a friend to help you move on Saturday and they decline with a heartfelt apology and reasonable excuse, your ""No worries,"" is appropriate.  But when you show up at a business with a fist full of hard-earned cash, do you feel relieved at being absolved and forgiven for some apparent behavioral breach or customer crime when an employee anoints you with, ""No problem?""  How did being served transmogrify into what sounds like the customer should offer an apology? ""No problem"" is fingernails across a chalkboard, or that stupid horn they blow at South African soccer games. So, how did the professionally sublime, ""It's my pleasure,"" devolve into ""No problem,"" the vuvuzela of customer service? One word: laziness. And it manifests as disregard at best and disrespect at worst. There are 228,132 words in the English language (I counted). Armed with this at once handy and massive linguistic toolbox, if an employee can't pay attention to a customer's words well enough to form an appropriate response, that's laziness. But as surely as the deliverer of an inappropriate ""No problem"" should be indicted for not saying, ""Please let me help you with this REAL problem of a broken product in an unopened box,"" or ""Thank you for your business,"" the laziness larceny isn't all theirs. ""No problem"" first offenders become recidivists because they have not been trained how to communicate as professionals, which begs our departure from the aural offense to follow the money. Once, I suggested to an offending waitress at a restaurant I frequent that she replace her ""No problem"" bad habit with ""It's my pleasure,"" or ""You're welcome."" It was obvious she didn't realize how her words hit customers, and to her credit, promised to try my idea. A month later she reported back that since she stopped suggesting there was a problem when there wasn't, her tips had gone up. Tips only defy gravity when customers are happy. And happy customers always find their way back to businesses that train employees to say ""Thank you"" instead of, well, you know. In the Age of the Customer, everything we sell is a commodity that can be bought at a dozen other places around town and a thousand online. As a Main Street business - or bank - you have only one differentiator: the positive personal experience the customer attributes directly, specifically and uniquely to your business. Which won't happen if your employees blow a vuvuzela at customers for merely showing up. Write this on a rock ... ""No problem"" is a big problem. Train your employees how to communicate for a positive and profitable customer experience. And then work on making eye contact.

122," By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday rejected Expedia Inc's request for an injunction that would have required United Airlines to continue providing fare data for flights after Sept. 30, when the companies' contract ends. U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel said Expedia had shown a ""likelihood of success"" on the merits of its breach of contract claim, but did not show a preliminary injunction was needed to avoid irreparable harm or serve the public interest. ""We welcome the ruling from the judge in favor of United which will minimize the risk of disrupting our customers' travel plans and ensure we can effectively serve customers who need to make changes to their itineraries purchased through Expedia,"" United said in an emailed statement. Expedia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The dispute came as some carriers try to reduce distribution costs by encouraging travelers to book directly rather than through online travel agencies such as Bellevue, Washington-based Expedia. Southwest Airlines Co has long relied on direct bookings, and JetBlue Airways Corp in October 2017 pulled its fares from several online agencies. Expedia accused United of trying to force a renegotiation of their 2011 contract by threatening to withhold fares for flights after Sept. 30, leaving it unable to book or change tickets. United countered that limiting fare listings would benefit travelers flying later, because the companies' ""coming divorce"" would leave Expedia unable to serve them. In his decision, Castel found no language in the contract between Expedia and United suggesting that United would withhold fare information in the final months, and no evidence that Expedia would be unable to service customers through Sept. 30. But he also found no proof that maintaining the ""contractual status quo"" would irreparably harm Expedia, even if the dispute led to customer confusion and hurt its reputation. Castel also said the public interest did not weigh in favor of a preliminary injunction. ""There is no serious issue as to the ability of members of the public to fly on their airline of their choosing,"" he wrote. ""Meaningful and prominent disclosure will mitigate any harm to the public."" The case is Expedia Inc v United Airlines Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-01066.

123," Earlier this week, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced new wireless earbuds under its Beats brand. They're joining the Powerbeats Wireless lineup, but represent a total overhaul. Called Powerbeats Pro, it's arguable that these new headphones outdo Apple's just-launched second-generation AirPods . A recent update to AirPods and completely revamped Powerbeats highlight Apple's vigorous efforts to ramp up its wearables business.  Powerbeats Pro. Image source: Beats. Apple and Beats didn't hold anything back with the latest iteration of Powerbeats. ""The result of a deep integration between Beats and Apple engineering, Powerbeats Pro features industry-leading battery life, advanced functionality, reliable connectivity, exceptional fit via the signature earhook design and beautiful fidelity,"" Beats said in a press release on Wednesday. The specs are impressive. First of all, the headphones are totally wireless, like Apple's AirPods. Though previous Powerbeats versions were wireless in terms of not needing to physically connect to a device in order to play music, they still had a wire that connected the earbuds to each other. In addition, Powerbeats Pro headphones are 23% smaller and 17% lighter than their predecessor, sport the same H1 chip in the second-generation AirPods, and provide up to nine hours of listening time on a single charge (compared to five hours for Apple's new AirPods). Finally, Beats completely reengineered its latest Powerbeats' fit. ""To achieve the best possible fit on the widest array of ears, over 20 configurations were electronically modeled and physically tested,"" Beats said. ""The result is a completely new, ergonomically angled acoustic housing that nests comfortably in the concha bowl of the ear with an off-axis nozzle."" Starting at $249.95, Apple has priced Powerbeats Pro as a premium product. Indeed, they're more expensive than the second-generation AirPods ($199 with a wireless case and $159 without). But given the Powerbeats Pro's compelling value proposition, the price seems fair. The headphones are set to launch next month. It's no surprise Apple is investing in the product development of its wireless headphones. Not only have AirPods been a major hit by themselves, but Apple's wearables business, which management defines as its Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats products, is seeing rapid growth. In the company's most recently reported quarter, wearables revenue jumped 50% year over year. Furthermore, the ""wearables, home, and accessories"" product segment (formerly called ""other products"") that Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats products fall into is Apple's fastest-growing segment . Trailing-12-month revenue from Apple's wearables, home, and accessories segment rose 34% year over year, trouncing the company's consolidated revenue growth rate of 9% over this same time frame. While investors' focus when it comes to Apple's wireless headphones is often on the company's namesake AirPods and not Beats products, the Powerbeats Pro's potential shouldn't be underestimated. After all, Powerbeats are the top-selling fitness headphones in the world -- and now they're better than ever. Apple has typically credited Apple Watch and AirPods to the strength of its wearables business. But with the tech giant doubling down on its Beats products with Powerbeats Pro, management may be betting Beats can kick into high gear, too.  10 stocks we like better than Apple

124," India ETFs may not have done as well as the global market early this year but the space picked up, showcasing the best rally globally last month. India's stock market hit a record high in early April, marking its first in seven months . FIIs have injected more than $8.4 billion into Indian stocks so far this year - the highest for Asia. India is the first among markets valued at more than $1 trillion to hit a high this year (read: Top ETF Stories of March ). Global investment banks such as BNP Paribas as well as Goldman Sachs recently upgraded India to 'Overweight' citing attractive valuations, continuity of flows, recovery in earnings trajectory and election hopes at the Centre. Goldman Sachs expects earnings to grow 16% this year , highest in the region. Let's discuss the tailwinds in details. Election Hopes & Monetary Policy Easing There has been a wave of optimism about the re-election of India's prime minister Narendra Modi's party in May. India stocks started rallying on such expectations as Modi's government is viewed as market-friendly. Also, on  Apr 4, the Reserve Bank of India decided to cut repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 6%. Such policy easing should boost India equities in the coming days. Dovish Fed The Fed has hinted at taking a patient stance toward the rate outlook citing growth worries. This should keep a check on the greenback strength this year and help promote investments in emerging economies like India (read: Rate Sensitive ETFs to Explode Higher Post Fed Minutes ). Consumer-Friendly Budget In February, Modi's government came up with an interim 2019 budget with 750 billion rupees ( about $10.6 billion ) in cash for farmers and solid tax cuts for payers in the lower rungs, to appease key voters ahead of a general election. The budget proposals lowered the tax burden for the lower middle class, by exempting people earning up to 500,000 rupees from the previous cap of 250,000 rupees . The consumer ETF Columbia India Consumer ETF INCO should benefit the maximum from the 2019-2020 budget. Solid Growth Story The Asian Development Bank has predicted India's GDP growth at 7.2% for 2019-20 and 7.3% for 2020-21, rebounding from two years of declining growth . Higher domestic demand should also drive India's GDP this year and the next. Per IMF data in October 2018, the Indian economy has a stronger real GDP growth outlook than the emerging economies bloc, developed economies and the global economy. Anything to Fret About? Having said that, we would like to note that India ETFs normally underperform if oil prices rally. This is because India is almost entirely dependent on imports for its oil needs. Since United States Oil USO and  United States Brent Oil BNO are up more than 25% this year, India ETFs have a reason to worry. ETFs in Focus In the past week (as of Apr 3, 2019), ETFs like First Trust India NIFTY 50 Equal Weight ETF NFTY , Columbia India Infrastructure Index Fund INXX , WisdomTree India Earnings Fund EPI , iShares MSCI India ETF INDA and Columbia India Consumer ETF INCO returned 1.02% to 2.0% (see all Asia-Pacific (Emerging) ETFs here).

After outsized results some analysts saw as distorted by the partial government shutdown in the prior two months, data showed U.S. employment growth accelerated from a 17-month low in March, buoyed by milder weather. ""We are certainly seeing lots of green shoots in the economy, especially service PMIs, employment numbers; the consumer is a really strong driver of this economy and GDP is inching up,"" said Janet Johnston, portfolio manager at TrimTabs Asset Management in New York. ""We are seeing a disconnect between the stock and the bond markets that the bond market thinks we are going to have a recession and the stock market is acting like the worst is over.""

133," By Laila Kearney and Scott DiSavino NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - After Texas pushed the United States over the last decade to become the world's biggest oil producer last year, the heart of the shale revolution is starting to show fatigue. The volume of crude being pumped out of Texas recently saw its first monthly dip in a year. Oil well productivity in Texas's Permian basin - the country's largest oil field - is falling, and the number of drilling rigs operating in the United States declined for six straight weeks before rebounding this week. ""For certain companies, production could start to flatline, even roll over"" in the second half of the year, said James West, a senior managing director for research analysts Evercore ISI. ""I think you will see revisions to the overall growth forecasts ... for U.S. production."" Evercore originally expected the land rig count to rise 6 percent in 2019; last week it revised its forecast to a 1 percent drop for the year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in March trimmed its crude production forecast to an average of 12.3 million barrels per day (bpd) for 2019 from 12.4 million bpd. That was the first time the EIA cut its production estimate since September. Morgan Stanley on Thursday shaved 100,000 bpd off its U.S. crude growth projection for the year due to well ""productivity improvements slowing, the rig count rolling over"" and guidance from exploration and production companies, it said. U.S. crude supply ballooned in 2018, which overall production rising by 1.7 million bpd to a record 10.9 million bpd in 2018. That was the biggest year-over-year increase in output, according to EIA data going back to 1859. The number of drilling rigs started to fall after domestic crude prices dropped to $42 a barrel in December from a peak of $76 in October, but prices have since recovered, with U.S. crude now at about $62. After posting its steepest drop in a quarter in three years, the rig count rose for the first time in seven weeks on Friday, though it still remains close to one-year lows, according to General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm. ""Usually there is about a six-month lag between a drop in rigs and an impact to production levels,"" said Jodi Quinnell, an analyst at Genscape. That means the full effect of the drop in rigs might not be seen for several months. Unless prices skyrocket, independent shale companies are expected to maintain lower levels of spending. U.S. drillers, heeding the wishes of investors, have been cutting spending in response to years of lackluster returns. While majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are expanding in Texas's Permian region, independent companies are not. While the major oil companies plan to spend about 16 percent more on U.S. drilling and completions in 2019 versus last year, independent exploration and production (E&P) companies are expected to cut spending by around 11 percent, according to financial services firm Cowen & Co. Lower amounts of oil are also being delivered per well, slowing the rate of output growth. In the Permian Basin, per-well productivity is projected to fall by about 6 percent in April 2019 compared with a year ago, according to federal data.

135," BAMAKO, April 5 (Reuters) - Thousands rallied in the Malian capital Bamako on Friday to protest at the failure of the government and international peacekeepers to stem rising ethnic and jihadist violence, notably the massacre of around 160 villagers last month. The protest was one of the largest in Mali in recent years. It followed the March 23 massacre by suspected militiamen from the Dogon ethnic group of rival Fulani herders in the village of Ogossagou, the deadliest act of ethnic bloodshed in West Africa's Sahel region in living memory. While helmeted riot police looked on, protesters held signs calling on Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and the United Nations MINUSMA peacekeeping mission to leave. Keita has responded to the attack on the Fulanis by disbanding an anti-jihadist vigilante group, whose fighters are suspected of being behind the massacre. Over 200 people had been killed by anti-jihadist self-defence groups in Mali since the start of this year, according to the United Nations, which has dispatched human rights experts to investigate the March attack. Friday's march of religious, civil society and opposition leaders reflects growing frustration at the escalating violence. ""We hold the government responsible for the deterioration of the situation,"" said former minister Hamadoun Dicko. Friday's march was largely peaceful, although at one point police fired tear gas and some protesters threw stones in response. Organisers have called for another protest next week.

138," In February 2018, The Wall Street Journal had predicted that Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) popular music-streaming service, Apple Music. would overtake rival Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) in the critical U.S. market over the summer. A few months later, Digital Music News reported that Apple had accomplished just that , citing an anonymous source at a ""major distributor"" that said Apple Music was ""a hair ahead"" of Spotify. CEO Tim Cook even seemingly validated the report a few weeks later on an earnings call by saying, ""It appears to us -- what we've been told is that [Apple Music] took the leadership position in North America during the quarter and we had leadership position in Japan."" While the U.S. is just part of the North American market, it is the largest music market in the world and many investors interpreted Cook's comments as confirmation. It turns out that Apple only recently became the top dog in paid music streaming in the U.S.  Image source: Apple. A fresh Wall Street Journal report this morning says Apple Music has finally overtaken Spotify in paid U.S. subscribers as of February. Apple Music had 28 million subscribers that month, compared to the 26 million subscribers Spotify had, according to the WSJ . Acknowledging its prior reporting, the Journal notes that Apple Music was expected to become No. 1 over six months ago, but Spotify was able to temporarily fend off the competition with a series of aggressive promotions. ""As we have previously discussed, Gross Margins are seasonally lower in Q1 and Q3 resulting from the costs of the major seasonal promotional campaigns we typically run in Q2 and Q4 each year,"" Spotify wrote in its November shareholder letter. ""A majority of the expense of these promotional subscribers is absorbed following the quarter of intake onto the platform."" The Swedish company also said in February that its fourth-quarter holiday promotion ""outperformed our expectations for new subscriber additions,"" adding 7 million subscribers worldwide over six weeks. Apple has been consistently adding more subscribers than Spotify each month, both in the U.S. and globally. The Mac maker's U.S. monthly growth rate is estimated at 2.6% to 3%, topping Spotify's 1.5% to 2%, according to the report. On a worldwide basis, Apple is adding subscribers at a rate of 2.4% to 2.8%, similarly above Spotify's 2% to 2.3%. The confusion highlights shortfalls in disclosures. Spotify provides investors with more granular geographical detail with four segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, and Rest of World. Apple gives investors no such information, and only provides occasional updates on the Apple Music subscriber base, typically when it hits certain milestones instead of on a quarterly basis (such as in earnings releases). Considering the fact that Apple Music is one of the company's most important services, and Apple wants investors to start treating it (and valuing it) like a services business, it should star t report ing this metric on a more regular basis.  10 stocks we like better than Apple

139," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It's official. After 25 years of marriage, Amazon  (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie have agreed on how they'll split up their commonly owned shares of Amazon stock. MacKenzie will keep one-fourth of them - worth roughly $35 billion - but will still let her ex-husband use the voting power linked to her stake.  The information was made available in an SEC filing, though most investors and journalists were first made aware of it via Twitter, where MacKenzie briefly explained the agreement on Thursday . She'll also be giving Jeff her stakes in Blue Origin and the Washington Post. The decision alleviates growing concerns that a contested division of assets could wrestle control of the company away from its CEO, potentially disrupting Bezos' long-term vision for the e-commerce giant that sometimes inspires short-term frustration. MacKenzie and Jeff met while working for the same hedge fund , D.E. Shaw , in 1992. A year later the two were married, and a year after that the couple were moving to Seattle. Jeff wrote Amazon's business plan in the car while MacKenzie drove. The rest, of course, is history. Amazon.com has become synonymous with ""e-commerce,"" largely because it does more of it than almost any outfit. Alibaba (NYSE:
BABA
) technically does more, but Alibaba is only a middleman. Amazon.com sells goods out of its own inventory as well as that of third parties. Amazon's history also includes becoming the second company in history to reach a market cap of $1 trillion, reaching that milestone in September just a few weeks after Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) did the same. By that time Jeff Bezos had already become the richest man in the world , though wild wealth still wasn't enough to sustain a happy marriage. Just a few months later, and within hours of announcing his impending divorce with MacKenzie, revelations of Bezos' affair with news anchor Lauren Sanchez surfaced. The two, as it turns out, had already been dating for eight months. Bolstering the scandalous nature of the fair: Sanchez's husband Patrick Whitesell was a friend of Jeff Bezos. Amazon stock holders have been worried that the sheer depth of the saga could at best prove distracting to the e-commerce company's CEO, and at worst, disruptive to the company. Like so many other organization, Amazon.com and its CEO are tightly linked. Their drive and vision are an important part of the corporate culture. Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) and its chief Elon Musk are one example. Mark Zuckerberg and his company Facebook (NASDAQ:
FB
) are another.  Bezos' role as the chief, face and ethos of Amazon, however, remain intact. He will still own roughly 12% of the company's total shares even after signing one-fourth of the couple's jointly-owned stake over to MacKenzie, and he will still be able to use her voting rights unless she sells shares or gives them away. While technically a minority stake, Jeff is still the company's biggest shareholder. Serving as CEO also adds some influence in the boardroom, as does the market's respect for the behemoth he's created. Jeff Bezos will also still be the world's richest man after the splitting of assets is completed. MacKenzie Bezos, however, won't be doing too badly herself. She'll become the world's fourth-richest woman once the divorce decree is finalized. The public documents regarding Amazon and other co-owned companies also don't make any mention of cash Jeff may be passing along to MacKenzie as part of the settlement. While no divorce is clean or easy, given the billion-dollar fortunes at stake and the fact that there was no prenuptial agreement , this one was much less messy than it could have been. Both parties fared well. So did shareholders. The market was preparing for the worst, including a loss of clear control of the company to an ex-spouse that had been thrust into a less-than-flattering spotlight. The outcome turned out to be amazingly amicable, and should allow Bezos and Amazon to continue doing 'business as usual.' As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

140," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Some investors on Wall Street might think that Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP ) stock has run its course. But with short-sellers' interest dwindling and focused elsewhere, a technical ""lift"" will inevitably drive shares higher, which makes now a good time to hop on to the bullish train for SNAP stock.  As someone from generation X, I'm not a fan of spending any of my social time on the Snapchat platform. But while I'm obviously not alone here, that's not a good reason for investors - old school or new school - to turn away from a low-risk, high-reward long position in Snap Inc stock. A month ago, SNAP stock surprised Wall Street by delivering stronger-than-forecast engagement numbers from its bread-and-butter younger demographic bases, as well as many other across-the-board goodies. And with Snap's management quick to tell Wall Street it is ""substantially closer to profitability"" , investors did more than simply spook SNAP stock's bearish population. Now it's time bulls suit up for a SNAP stock breakout. This is especially true given that Snap shares have driven into a key intersection on the price chart and might be receiving a helpful lift from recently IPO'ed rideshare company Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT ) whose stock seemingly has bears' collective attention. Click to Enlarge It has been a very good month since SNAP stock reported earnings. As most market watchers are aware, the report throttled shares higher by 22% in the immediate aftermath. And that's great for investors that were already in it, to win it … well, almost everybody. More importantly for the longer-term prospects and today's buyers of SNAP stock, last month's results have had the impact of shedding Snap's short interest by more than 30% to a reasonable 7% of the float. That's good news, but that's not the end of the story either. Over the period Snap shares have also put together a fully formed uptrend. And with SNAP stock now at a critical intersection of converging resistance lines, it's anticipated a breakout is at hand as other bullish trend traders step up to the plate and the last few bears throw in the towel. Investors looking to position into SNAP stock should be ready to buy shares on a higher-volume breakout that's 10 cents above the consolidation high of $11.67, which has developed over the past couple weeks. With immediate resistance cleared on strong participation, this type of breakout supports a rally toward SNAP stock's next layers of resistance in-between $13 - $15 and an area where partial profits can be locked in. To ensure long exposure remains tethered to the breakout and a trend which remains an ally of bulls, I'd recommend placing an initial stop slightly beneath Thursday's doji low of $11.04 after new highs are established. In some ways, the exit may seem like this position is playing SNAP stock awfully tight. However, since we're trying to catch a ride on board a legitimate breakout and with exposure limited to 6%, this looks like a good way to remain profitable, while Snap's business is still looking to turn that corner.

144," WASHINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up their latest round of trade talks on Friday and were scheduled to resume discussions next week to try to secure a pact that would end a tit-for-tat tariff battle that has roiled global markets. The two sides offered few details of the progress as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He concluded three days of meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said a deal could be announced in the next four weeks. Washington and Beijing in 2018 slapped import duties on each other's products that have cost the world's two largest economies billions of dollars and disrupted manufacturing and supply chains. The United States is seeking reforms to Chinese practices that it says result in the theft of U.S. intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology from U.S. companies to Chinese firms. The negotiations included intellectual property, or IP, forced technology transfer, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, services, purchases and enforcement, the statement said. White house adviser Larry Kudlow, speaking on Bloomberg Television earlier in the day, said Liu was due back in Beijing after Friday's talks, but the two sides would press ahead to resolve remaining differences by video link. ""There's no let-up here, this is an ongoing process,"" Kudlow said. Washington also has demanded that Beijing curb industrial subsidies, open its economy wider to U.S. companies, and increase purchases of U.S. goods including farm and energy commodities to shrink the gaping trade deficit with China. ""We are making headway in a lot of areas. That includes enforcement, that includes IP theft, that includes forced technology transfers, ownership, cyberspace, commodities and all the rest of it,"" Kudlow said. ""Those are of course in the middle of the negotiations that are ongoing, but we've come further and farther than ever before."" While some reform pledges by Beijing are largely set, including an agreement to avoid currency manipulation, an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China keeps its pledges and the status of U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods must be resolved. The plan to continue the discussions was taken as a positive sign. ""The fact that they're still talking - and talking positively about the discussions - suggests they both think they're on the path to a resolution,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents U.S. firms doing business in China ",24.17999999999938,1
145," Buying or selling stocks based on the shifting political moods in the U.S. (or any other country) isn't a good investing strategy. That doesn't mean, though, that politics have no impact on companies. Over the last two years, solar and wind energy companies have struggled due to President Donald Trump's decisions to impose tariffs on solar panels and push policies that explicitly make it easier for fossil fuels to compete in electricity markets. But the White House is not the only place from which political winds blow. California now mandates that solar energy systems be installed on all new homes built in the state, and Hawaii has mandated 100% renewable energy for its electrical grid by 2045. At the federal level, the ""Green New Deal"" is gaining some traction, changing the narrative nationwide. If anything close to that proposal eventually gets passed and signed into law, it would supercharge a few stocks in renewable energy, particularly in the solar segment.  Image source: First Solar. There are only two major solar panel makers with factories in the U.S.: First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR) , which has a manufacturing plant in Ohio, and SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) , which acquired a manufacturing facility in Oregon . Because buyers of their domestically made products don't have to pay the tariffs currently levied on imported solar panels, they are enjoying a cost advantage. And they can also charge something of a premium for that ""made in the U.S.A."" emblem. If the ""Green New Deal"" incentivizes U.S. solar manufacturing -- the resolution suggests ""expanding renewable energy manufacturing"" -- these are the two solar companies that stand to benefit most. They're already in America, and could expand their facilities quickly if the economics justified doing so. Solar power system installers could see their potential market soar. In 2018, 10,600 megawatt s (MW) of solar power capacity and 6,600 MW of wind were installed. If the government was supporting renewables, annual installations of solar and wind could collectively rise to nearly 100,000 MW to meet the grid's needs for new power plants each year, growing the industry more than five-fold. Residential solar installers like Sunrun (NASDAQ: RUN) and Vivint Solar (NYSE: VSLR) are just starting to tap into their potential. In 2018, they installed 373 MW and 196 MW of rooftop solar systems, respectively. The vast majority of residential installations are still in California, so a Green New Deal that supported solar nationwide could make it more attractive in markets it has yet to penetrate widely. That would also help component suppliers like SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ: SEDG) and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) , which supply inverters and power optimizers to installers. Because they sell to many installers, if the residential market grows, it wouldn't matter as much to them whether Sunrun or Vivint Solar gain or lose market share. The big-money market in solar is still utility-scale solar projects. They aren't as valuable as residential solar on a per-watt basis (about $1 versus $3 per watt) but those projects can be hundreds of megawatts in size. That makes for big opportunities for manufacturers, installers, and financiers. Three of the biggest renewable energy asset owners in the country are TerraForm Power (NASDAQ: TERP) , Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE: BEP) , and NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) . These companies aren't going to be huge growth opportunities because they aren't manufacturing or installing wind or solar projects, but they could grow steadily for decades given their ownership of clean energy assets. As icing on the cake, the dividends they pay out are currently yielding 5.5%, 6.2%, and 4%, respectively -- excellent yields given the companies' long-term growth potential. As I said earlier, buying or selling stocks based on political projections alone is a terrible investment strategy. But investors do need to understand how politics can impact their stocks, for better or worse. Right now, the idea of expanding clean (green) energy production and manufacturing in the U.S. has serious popularity, and it looks to be gaining momentum. If that trend persists, and any sort of ""Green New Deal"" passes in Washington, D.C., these stocks could all be big winners. In the meantime, states like California, Washington, Arizona, and Florida are opening up incentives and pathways to expand renewable energy production. Those state-level incentives will keep the renewable energy industry on its feet for the next couple of years, but a big, sweeping change like the Green New Deal may be necessary for these stocks to be huge winners for investors.  10 stocks we like better than First Solar

146," By Jason Neely and Duncan Miriri ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia/NAKURU, Kenya April 5 (Reuters) - Mourning families of Ethiopian Airlines passengers who died in last month's crash are asking awkward and angry questions of U.S. planemaker Boeing after closely following a preliminary report into the disaster. Though Ethiopian investigators' remit was not to find blame, they implicitly pointed at Boeing by recommending it fix a faulty system and saying pilots followed pre-established procedures, before the 737 MAX crashed killing all 157 on board. ""Boeing - they knew the problem already,"" she said, referring to an automatic anti-stall system in the MAX model that tipped the jets down in both cases due to faulty sensors. ""If they could have announced the problem to the airlines first, the accident may not have happened,"" she told Reuters in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Boeing has expressed condolences and promised a software fix. It will also have awkward questions of its own - over whether the Ethiopian crew correctly followed guidance not to restore power to the anti-stall system following sensor damage, and why the plane was also at unusually high thrust. For Konjit, the report's release on Thursday brought back her last words with her brother, who called after takeoff to say hello as the family lived in the flight path. ""He asked me to go outside and see the plane because he was just above our home,"" she said, sitting in a dimly lit front room in front of a portrait from Sintayehu's university graduation and a row of burned candles. ""I called him again and asked how the network was working and he answered 'I don't know, it's just working until now' and then 'good bye'. I think it's at that time that the accident happened."" Flight 302 had taken off late, at 8:38 a.m., and contact was lost six minutes later. It crashed into a dusty plain under still blue skies with such force that much of the wreckage was buried in the dry earth.  ""PROFITS BEFORE LIVES""? Among those on board were three generations of one Kenyan family - grandmother Anne Wangui Karanja, her daughter and her three young grandchildren. In the back yard of the family home in the central Kenyan town of Nakuru, bunches of white roses were wilting on a newly-built stone memorial, emblazoned with photos, dates of birth and words of remembrance. ""From the report, we gather that the manufacturer is the problem,"" said Quindos Karanja, who lost his mother, sister, nieces and nephew. ""My anger comes in because they (Boeing) were putting profits before lives."" The family read the crash report online as soon as it was published, and have followed news coverage with the aid of a stream of lawyers arriving at their home. ""It is good that the CEO of Boeing came out and owned up, but all we want, before these planes go back into the skies, is that they make sure everything is taken care of,"" Karanja said. ""We don't want to have such a tragedy because it is very painful,"" he said. Boeing has not admitted liability, but its boss Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday the company was working to eliminate the risk of ""erroneous activation"" of the so-called MCAS anti-stall system via a software update and pilot training. The 737 MAX fleet has been grounded worldwide as a precaution. If culpability is found, it could open the world's biggest planemaker to a slew of lawsuits. Relatives of an American woman killed in the crash, Samya Stumo, filed the first lawsuit on behalf of a U.S. victim in Chicago. The complaint targeted Boeing and Rosemount Aerospace Inc, the manufacturer of the sensor at the heart of the inquiry. Stumo is the niece of consumer activist Ralph Nader, who has called for a boycott of the 737 MAX.

147," By Barbara Lewis April 5 (Reuters) - Copper producers must collectively raise their game to improve the metal's ethical and green credentials as ageing mines require more water and energy to produce the same amount of metal, one of BHP's most senior executives said on Friday. Many in the industry have emphasised the importance of copper in the quest for a lower carbon economy as its properties as an electricity conductor hand it a leading role in any shift to electric vehicles and a modernised grid. ""In order to fully seize the opportunity to be part of a sustainable future, we need to minimise our material and environmental footprints,"" Daniel Malchuk, president of operations at BHP's, Minerals Americas, said in a speech in Santiago, where industry executives are attending a copper conference over the coming days. ""Collectively, we have to deliver our products more sustainably with the ethical end-consumer in mind,"" he said, according to a copy of the speech. Referring to other industries, such as technology, where Apple Inc, for instance, is working to monitor its supply chain, Malchuk said copper producers needed transparency and independent oversight from the mine to the end-user. ""The sustainability challenge is by far the biggest challenge of our generation. We must respond to this by lifting our game collectively,"" he said. He also cited findings from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that by 2060, copper is set to have a worse environmental footprint compared to now and to other metals on a per tonne basis if the current trend continues. Mining in general is struggling to win investor trust after the Vale dam disaster in January was a reminder of the risks surrounding mining. Some 300 people are estimated to have died, making its Brazil's most lethal mining accident. Vale, through its Samarco joint venture with BHP, also shares the blame for a dam disaster in 2015, which killed far fewer people, but was ranked Brazil's worst environmental disaster. BHP, the world's biggest listed miner and biggest producer of coking coal, used in steel, says it strives to reduce its environmental impact. In Chile, it says it has invested in the Kelar gas-fired power plant, which it said can aid the shift to renewable energy because the gas can offset the intermittency of wind and solar.

148," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Big, bad Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) is at it again. Striving to control everything in your home and life, in an effort to boost its results and ultimately Amazon stock, it's reportedly looking to rival Roku's (NASDAQ:
ROKU
) free ad-supported streaming services. Naturally, Roku stock took a small dive on the news, which was reported on Apr 3. Source: Shutterstock  If you own Roku stock, don't let Jeff Bezos scare you into selling your stock. Amazon has huge ambitions, I'll grant you, but Roku has something Amazon doesn't: authenticity. ROKU is a pure-play streaming business that manufactures streaming players and has its own operating system that's integrated into Roku TVs which are built by various TV manufacturers who license the technology. ROKU also offers ad-supported and ad-free content through the Roku Channel. In a nutshell, it has three revenue streams: the sale of players, licensing fees, and advertising and subscription fees. It has two business segments: Player and Platform. That's it. That's all. It doesn't sell video doorbells or personal assistants or books or anything else that's unrelated to video streaming. When investors buy Roku stock, they know what they're getting. ROKU might not have the financial might of Amazon, but it isn't straying too far from its stated business model. There's a lot to be said for businesses that stick to their knitting. They generally can do a better job of focusing on the task at hand. One only has to look at the retail industry to see that, despite Amazon's best efforts, brick-and-mortar retailers are alive and well in an omnichannel world. Consider this headline from February 2013: "" Best Buy is the Newest Amazon Showroom - How can a Retailer Battle ""Showrooming?""  ""The top 2 stores that lost the most customers due to this trend in 2012 were Best Buy and Walmart reflecting 46% of showroomers,"" stated the article. ""Other stores impacted are Target, Home Depot, Lowes and Barnes and Noble."" Well, since that article was written, Best Buy (NYSE:
BBY
) and Walmart (NYSE:
WMT
) have seen their stocks appreciate by 40% and 350% respectively. The other stocks on the list, besides Barnes & Noble (NYSE:
BKS
), have also done well. Each of these companies adapted to the competitive threats faced by Amazon and managed to thrive in a business environment that was seemingly stacked against them. ROKU won't be different. It can't worry about what Jeff Bezos is doing to disrupt its business. Although  it doesn't hurt to remain informed about what others in your industry are doing, ROKU has  got to lead the streaming industry into the future proactively. That is, it has to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. As Wayne Gretzky used to say, ""You go where the puck is going to be, not where it is at that moment."" It's called vision, and I happen to think that Roku's got plenty of it. I've been a ROKU believer since late 2017, not too long after ROKU stock went public at $14 a share. Since then, Roku Inc stock has had its ups and downs, none bigger than its 63% decline in the final quarter of 2018. In December, I reiterated my belief that ROKU would be a very profitable company someday, especially if it continues to grow its active accounts and viewing hours. It's that simple. ""However, if Roku's assertion that all TV will be streamed and so too will TV advertising, a prediction I tend to agree with (proves accurate). the future price of its stock will be much higher than $77.57,"" I wrote in an article published on Dec. 3. ""But first Roku has to make a fiscal profit. When it does that, the sky's the limit,"" I added. I still believe that. So, how did Roku stock do in 2018 in terms of active accounts and viewing hours? Active accounts increased by 40% to 27.1 million, while the average active account viewed 885.61 hours in 2018, 15.5% higher than a year earlier. As a result, ROKU's average revenue per user (ARPU) increased by 330.4% from $4.17 to $17.95. That's quite a boost. On the bottom line, ROKU lost $8.9 million on $742.5 million in revenue. In 2019, it expects its sales to go over $1 billion. In 2018, it had adjusted EBITDA of $33 million, up significantly from the year before. In 2019, it expects to break even on EBITDA as it continues to add new employees to manage its growth in the U.S. and internationally. All I can say about Amazon is, ""bring it on."" Roku's more than ready to meet the challenge. If the markets keep moving higher in 2019 (a big if), I could see Roku stock flirting with $80, or even $100, despite more than doubling in price year to date, as of midday on Apr. 5.. But it's got to keep its eye on the ball and keep growing those two figures I mentioned. That's the key to the success of Roku stock. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

149," Shares of Syros Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: SYRS) fell more than 26% today after the development-stage company announced the pricing of a stock offering. The business will sell roughly 8.7 million shares of common stock at $7.50 per share, in addition to warrants allowing the purchase of additional shares of common stock in the future. All of the transactions are expected to raise approximately $70 million in gross proceeds. The dilution will sting shareholders, but management is wisely taking advantage of the fact that shares had gained 75% from the beginning of 2019 to the time the share offering was announced. That means fewer shares can be issued to raise more capital as compared to an offering at a lower share price. Considering the early-stage nature of the company's pipeline and the fact the business reported an operating loss of $64 million in 2018, it was a well-timed move in the grand scheme of things. As of 1:20 p.m. EDT, the stock had settled to a 24.3% loss.  Image source: Getty Images. Syros Pharmaceuticals is developing a pipeline of drug candidates aiming to safely and predictably control the level of gene expression as a way to treat disease. For example, certain cancer cells might overexpress a gene that allows them to elude the body's immune system, but it might be possible to force cancer cells to return to a more ""normal"" profile of gene expression and thus make them susceptible to the immune system and/or other cancer drugs. It's an intriguing idea but one that has mostly led to disappointing results to date . Researchers still don't have a great understanding of the complex networks cancer cells use to communicate, which makes it unlikely that targeting a single gene or protein will have much of an effect. That won't stop Syros Pharmaceuticals from testing its novel technology platform, which will be a little easier to do following the latest capital raise. The $70 million in gross proceeds will be added to an end-of-year cash balance of approximately $100 million in 2018. Syros Pharmaceuticals stock is down today in response to the expected dilution from a share offering. Increasing the number of shares outstanding makes each share less valuable. That said, it's a wise move by management, especially considering the stock's impressive rise so far in 2019 and a slew of ongoing clinical trials. But given the uncertainty of the company's approach to controlling gene expression and a lack of successful results, investors are better off steering clear of this early-stage pharma altogether.  10 stocks we like better than Syros Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

160,"In January of 2018, the U.S. economy surprised to the upside at nearly every turn. Since that time, however, the fundamentals have slowly deteriorated. Consider the Citi Economic Surprise Index (( ESI )). The popular measure compares actual data against estimates. Remarkably, the indicator has been trending downward for 15 months. Perhaps ironically, the S&P 500 now trades at higher levels than when the fundamental backdrop had been much stronger. For many stock investors, then, weak fundamentals are synonymous with the exciting prospect of ever-lower borrowing costs and easy access to cheap capital.  Although the broader U.S. benchmarks are defying economic uncertainty, significant corners of the equity universe have yet to recover the highs that they reached in January of 2018. Financials ( XLF ), Energy ( XLE ), Transportation ( XTN ), Value ( IWD ), All-World ex U.S. (VEU) - these areas have been laboring for the last 15 months.  When it comes to propelling the S&P 500 higher, defensive late-cycle sectors like Utilities (XLU) and Consumer Staples (XLP) are helping to lead the charge. Indeed, a defensive equity approach may be a sensible path for participating in more upside while minimizing the possibility of a dramatic repricing of risk. Global malaise is particularly burdensome. From Europe to Japan, Canada to Australia, growth has softened considerably. For example, German GDP is predicted to grow at just 0.8% for 2019. And its manufacturing sector has experienced three consecutive months of full-blown contraction. In fact, troubles abroad are having a decidedly negative impact on the earnings per share of S&P 500 corporations. Some analysts are forecasting earnings growth of 1.5% for the entirety of 2019 . That's a far cry from the 20% EPS advance in 2018. In actuality, the earnings per stock share picture fails to tell the true story. Profitability looks ""OK"" because the number of stock shares in existence has decreased considerably. True profits are stuck back in 2012.  Most understand why earnings per share continue to seem reasonable in the forward price-to-earnings metric. Former Federal Reserve committee member Bill Dudley recently stated, ""During this expansion, companies have levered up, borrowing money to buy back shares and deliberately allowing their credit ratings to decline."" The humor in Dudley's assessment? He refused to acknowledge the Fed's role in depressing the cost of capital, that is, when the central bank manipulated rates lower for the better part of a decade, the traditional easing and quantitative easing policies led corporations to lever up to record debt levels for the purpose of goosing stock prices.  Consumers have shown more restraint. Yet they too have been showing signs of stress. Personal income as a source of spending has been hitting lower lows. Meanwhile, they're increasingly employing credit to meet their spending needs and desires.  On the labor force front, ADP found that businesses added personnel at the slowest pace in 18 months . Friday's BLS report, however, pointed to nearly 200,000 new positions in March. Other data show that the number of people filing for unemployment benefits just hit a 49-year low. That statistic seems to contradict the rising trend in layoffs.  What might one do with the wide variety of evidence that contradicts and confounds? Listen to the bond market . The three-month T-Bill yields more than the one-year Treasury. The three-month actually yields more than the one-year, two-year, five-year and seven-year. Inversions along the Treasury curve are exceptionally reliable in forecasting recessionary pressures. We already have seen the stock market reclaim losses on the heels of a monstrous Fed pivot from tightening to neutrality. Moreover, the bulk of China trade optimism is largely priced in. Is there reason to believe in additional catalysts for supersized stock gains from here? The Fed pivot only bought a reprieve. The last three recessions occurred shortly after the Fed began cutting rates for the first time in a campaign.

162," By Kenneth Li and Stephen Nellis April 5 (Reuters) - Apple Inc's streaming music service overtook rival Spotify Technology SA in terms of paid subscribers in the United States, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. Apple's service had 28 million subscribers as of the end of February compared with Spotify's 26 million paid subscribers, the person said. Neither Apple nor Spotify disclose country-level listener data, and both firms declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Apple has overtaken Spotify on the metric. Apple's streaming service is part of a broader push at the company to make money off subscriptions and services as iPhone sales slow. Last month the company announced a news, television and gaming subscriptions, as well as a credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Spotify likely still has more paying users than Apple Music, with 96 million premium subscribers and 207 million month active users as of its most recent earnings report in February. The company said in its report that it has 28.8 million premium subscribers and 62.1 million monthly active listeners in its North American region, which includes Canada but not Mexico. Apple does not regularly disclose how many subscribers it has, and the last official count - 50 million - came almost a year ago in May of 2018. About 67 million of Spotify's premium subscribers are outside of North America, the company said in its most recent quarterly report. ",24.17999999999938,1

165," BRUSSELS, April 5 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo plans to launch a licensing round this year for more than 20 onshore oil and gas blocks, the oil ministry said on Friday, its first since adopting a new hydrocarbons code in 2015. Congo, Africa's leading copper miner, has pumped just 25,000 barrels of oil per day for years despite sitting on up to 5 billion barrels of reserves. The hydrocarbons code was meant to a revive the haphazardly regulated sector by imposing new transparency, such as requiring public tenders for exploration and exploitation permits. The licensing round would still have to until President Felix Tshisekedi, who took office in January, names a new government in the coming months, he said, speaking by telephone. Anglo-French oil and gas company Perenco is Congo's only active producer. France's Total also holds an exploration permit near the eastern border with Uganda. Government efforts to ramp up oil exploration have met resistance from environmentalists, who have objected to exploration inside protected national parks. In December, former President Joseph Kabila awarded an oil drilling licence that overlaps with a wildlife-rich UNESCO world heritage site and forms part of the world's second largest rainforest.

167," To maintain a healthy portfolio, it is necessary to protect it from market gyrations. Ahead of the World Health Day, let us look at ways to nourish your ETF portfolio for better gains. We have also highlighted an ETF from each category and their price performance over the past five years.  Higher Volume

An ETF should have enough liquidity in order to easily purchase and sell on the market. Volume, or the number of shares traded in a particular period, is definitely the most important consideration for determining the liquidity of a particular fund. A higher volume provides easy access to move in and out of the product, keeping the bid/ask spreads tight. Further, greater volume ensures easy creation and redemption of shares in the fund's basket, which is a regular and vital mechanism.

While there are several ETFs that trade in higher volumes, SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY looks an attractive pick. This ETF provides exposure to 505 largest U.S. companies by tracking the S&P 500 Index. Information technology accounts for 21.4% of the assets, while healthcare, financials, consumer discretionary and communication services round off the next spots with double-digit exposure each. SPY is one of the largest and the most popular ETFs in the large-cap space with AUM of $269.1 billion and average daily volume of around 106.6 million shares. It charges investors 9 bps in annual fees and surged more than 67% over the past five years. The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) (read: 10 Stocks Powering S&P 500 ETF in the 10-Year Bull Run ).

Diversification

Designing a diversified investment portfolio involves the inclusion of stocks of different companies, securities and industries in order to minimize risks and achieve optimal risk-adjusted returns. While there are several ETFs that offer diversification benefits, Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP would be an interesting choice, as it offers almost equal allocation of the stocks of the S&P 500 Index.

The fund tracks the S&P Equal Weight Index, which equally weights the stocks in the S&P 500 Index. Holding 505 stocks in its basket, the ETF puts roughly 0.25% in each stock. Information technology, industrials, financials, consumer discretionary and healthcare are the top five sectors, each with double-digit exposure. The fund has amassed nearly $15.8 billion in its asset base. It witnesses average daily volume of more than 1.2 million shares. It charges 20 bps in fees per year from investors and gained about 56% over the past five years. RSP has a Zacks ETF Rank #3.

Blend

Blend funds consist of a mix of both growth and value stocks, and are considered most suitable in any type of market. This is because these funds harness their momentum in earnings to create a positive bias in the market, resulting in improved share prices. At the same time, these tap buying opportunities at depressed stock prices hoping for capital appreciation when the stock finally reflects its true market price. In particular, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO having a Zacks ETF Rank #2 will be a lucrative choice.

The ETF offers exposure to a broad basket of 509 U.S. stocks by tracking the S&P 500 Index. It has a nice mix of growth, value and blend stocks with each holding no more than 3.7% of the assets. About 20.6% of the portfolio is dominated by information technology while health care, financials, and communication services round off the next three spots with a double-digit allocation each. VOO has AUM of $109.2 billion and trades in average daily volume of around 3.9 million shares. It charges 4 bps in fees and surged about 68% in the last five years.

Dividend

Dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. Dividend-focused products offer both safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less vulnerable to volatility in stock prices. While several choices are available in the dividend space, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF VIG looks attractive (read: Top-Ranked Dividend ETFs Crushing the Market ).

This is the largest and most-popular ETF in the dividend space with AUM of $33 billion and average daily volume of about 1.3 million shares. The fund follows the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, which is composed of high quality stocks that have a record of growing dividend year over year. It holds 180 securities in the basket with none accounting for more than 4.5% share. However, it is inclined toward industrials which comprise 31.8% while consumer services, healthcare and consumer goods round off the next three spots. The fund charges 8 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3. It has returned about 61% over the past five years.

Quality

Quality ETFs are generally rich in value characteristics as these focus on stocks with high quality scores based on three fundamentals - high return on equity, stable earnings growth and low financial leverage. This approach seeks investments in safer stocks and reduces volatility when compared with plain vanilla funds. Academic research shows that high-quality companies consistently deliver superior risk-adjusted returns than the broader market over the long term (read: Can Smart Beta & Factor ETFs Beat the Market? ).

While there are several quality ETFs available in the space, iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF QUAL is the most popular. This fund provides exposure to stocks exhibiting positive fundamentals (high return on equity, stable year-over-year earnings growth, and low financial leverage) by tracking the MSCI USA Sector Neutral Quality Index. Holding 125 securities in its basket, it has moderate concentrated across sectors, with each holding no more than 4.12% share. Information technology makes up 21.5% of the portfolio while healthcare, financials, communications, and consumer discretionary round off the next three spots. The product has amassed $10.4 billion in its asset base and charges 15 bps in annual fees from investors. Average trading volume is solid at around 1.4 million shares per day. The fund has surged nearly 73% over the past five years.

168," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Any investor even casually acquainted with Alibaba Group Holdings (NYSE:
BABA
) knows about its massive ecommerce business and its burgeoning cloud computing business. However, according to Bank of America, BABA stock affiliate Ant Financial's Alipay payment app is a much bigger deal than investors may realize.  Bank of America analyst Eddy Leung calls Alipay a ""super app."" Here are some of the numbers driving that high praise. Americans are familiar with digital payment leader PayPal (NASDAQ:
PYPL
). As of the end of Q4, PayPal had an estimated 267 million global active accounts . Leung estimates Alipay has more than 600 million mobile users. In addition, Alipay has the largest mobile and PC market share in Chinese payments at roughly 50%. Even better, that market share has barely budged since late 2016. Alipay is dominating the market and keeping competitors like Tencent (OTC:
TCEHY
) and Baidu (NASDAQ:
BIDU
) at bay. Alipay offers a variety of useful payment services within it's app. It also is expanding its services outside of payments. For example, Alipay now offers transportation pass services for bikes and buses in some large cities. It also offers delivery services and dining reservation services. Alipay users have utility booking and payment services at their fingertips. Alipay has also implemented a user rewards credit system and even offers charitable donations services. Leung says Alipay's large, stable market share allows it to focus on monetizing its users and increasing engagement rather than growing its user base. The latest mobile app usage data from China suggests those efforts are paying off. Alipay is already the third most popular app in China in terms of monthly active users behind only WeChat and QQ. It's still a distant fifth place in terms of engagement. However, engagement numbers are significantly higher than they were just a couple of years ago. More than 80 percent of Alipay users now use the app for multiple services, according to Bank of America. More than 60 percent use at least three services, while more than 20 percent use five or more different services. Service use is up across the board compared to a year ago. ""We see Ant Financial ('Ant')'s Alipay app emerging into a large mobile platform, going beyond its leading position in an already very large vertical segment and increasingly serving the needs in everyday life of its users and offering bigger opportunities to cooperate with the other business units under Alibaba,"" Leung says. Whether because of the ongoing trade war with China, distrust of Alibaba's corporate structure or the fact that U.S. investors are more familiar with Amazon's services, Alibaba stock is often overlooked by U.S. investors. As a result, Alibaba has put up staggering growth numbers in ecommerce and cloud services that have put Amazon to shame in recent quarters. Yet BABA stock has barely moved in the past year. Leung and Bank of America have a ""buy"" rating and $215 price target for BABA stock. I recently wrote about why some of the common bear arguments against Alibaba don't hold weight . Alibaba's market is much bigger and faster-growing than the U.S. market, it is essentially protected from international competitors and it is on the cutting edge of technologies that will dominate 21st-century China. Alipay is just one of the dozens of businesses under Alibaba's wing that have massive long-term disruptive potential. As of this writing, Wayne Duggan was long BABA stock.

169," By Sruthi Shankar and Shreyashi Sanyal April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday boosted by better-than-expected job growth in March, which eased concerns of a domestic slowdown, and hopes that the United States and China would resolve their trade dispute. The gains put the benchmark S&P 500 on track to close higher for seven days in a row, in what could be its best such winning streak since October 2017. ""When the February numbers came out, the fear at the time was that maybe a slowdown is closer than expected. These numbers are definitely helping reduce them,"" said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada. The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls rose by 196,000 jobs last month, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 180,000. Data for February was revised up to show payrolls advancing by 33,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 20,000, the smallest job gain since September 2017. However, wage increases slowed in March leaving the data broadly supportive of the Federal Reserve's decision last month to suspend its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy. Trade hopes and a dovish Fed have lifted the S&P 500 to its highest since Oct. 9, putting the index 1.7% away from an all-time high of 2,940.91 points. Stocks across the world got a lift from President Donald Trump's comments on Thursday that Beijing and Washington were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks. Although Trump later said he would not predict that a deal will be reached. At 1:01 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 23.54 points, or 0.09%, at 26,408.17, the S&P 500 was up 10.13 points, or 0.35%, at 2,889.52 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 39.99 points, or 0.51%, at 7,931.77. Bank stocks, which tend to benefit from a rising interest rates, dipped 0.19%. Investors will focus on falling profits and lower interest rates as next week major U.S. banks kick off what analysts expect to be the first quarter of contracting corporate earnings since 2016. Energy stocks jumped 1.45%, the most among the eight major S&P indexes that were trading higher, as oil prices firmed.

171," In the first quarter of 2019, US stocks posted their best quarterly performance since the financial crisis. While there are still some concerns about economic growth abroad, many now see this ""bad"" news as ""good"" news on hopes of continued monetary stimulus.  In fact, dovish turns by the central banks is one of the main reasons for stocks' strong rebound in 2019. The US economy remains in a much better position compared with other major economies. Further, with muted inflation, the Fed is expected to refrain from raising rates. The odds of a rate cut are now higher than those for a rate hike. The S&P 500 index rose 13% in Q1 and the Dow returned 11% but the best performer was the tech heavy Nasdaq that soared more than 16%.

172," One of this year's most surprising winners is Snap (NYSE: SNAP) , and perhaps the bigger shock is how many naysayers are changing their minds despite the buoyant shares that would make it easier to validate their earlier valuation fears. Jonathan Kees at Summit Insights is the latest analyst to shake his bearish ways when it comes to Snapchat's parent company. Kees is upgrading his rating from sell to hold following new content initiatives announced by Snap on Thursday. He is doubling his price target from $5 to $10, but that's barely keeping up with the stock's heady gains in recent months. Snap stock has more than doubled in 2019, up 105% so far this year.  Image source: Snap. Summit Insights' Kees isn't necessarily bullish on Snap. His new $10 price target is actually below where the shares are now. However, he's now another former bear who is at least conceding that momentum isn't on the side of the short-sellers. Snap unveiled a platform for multiplayer games on Thursday, something that should make Snapchat more engaging if even a small chunk of its 186 million active users decides to play. Snap also introduced new services and advertising products that should help increase its already impressive gains in monetizing its currently stagnant audience levels. Revenue rose a better-than-expected 36% in Snap's latest quarter , fueled entirely by a 37% increase in average revenue per user. Because it's a free platform for consumers, Snap's growth relies on either gains in its active user base -- something that's just not happening -- or getting better about being sticky enough for folks to lean on the platform more while also making it more compelling for marketers trying to reach Snapchat users. Snapchat is competing against everyone from Instagram to fresh air for user engagement, and the key here is to improve its monetization without making the jaded youngsters on its platform recoil from the commercialization. Snap's success on that front finds bearish and even neutral analysts boosting their outlooks  on the company. Snap continues to trade well below its $17 IPO price, but it has made the jump from mid-single-digits to the preteens in just the past three months. The stock's popularity should at least put an end to Snap and Snapchat as the butt of dot-com jokes, and that could have a favorable impact on the perception of the platform itself with users. It's not just the stock that's moving. Analysts now see Snap losing half as much money in 2020 as they did when this year began. If you think the stock is moving now, just wait until we get the first whiffs of actual active user growth.  10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.

173,"The broad-based major European indices closed higher in Friday trading led by mining and semiconductor stocks. In economic news, UK Prime Minister Theresa May has written to the European Union to request another delay for Brexit until June 30. May said that if UK MPs approve a deal in time, the UK should be able to leave before European Parliamentary elections on May 23. However, she said that the UK would field candidates for the elections in case the MPs still can't reach an agreement. Meanwhile, European output of automobiles and auto parts declined for the sixth month running in March, according to IHS Markit. The rate of contraction eased slightly since February, but remained steep as new orders dropped at its strongest rate since December 2012. Employment fell at the fastest rate since November 2012, and input prices declined for the first time in nearly three years, although only marginally. Metals and mining was also another weak sector in March as output fell for the seventh straight month, and at the fastest rate since January 2013. Metal producers also lowered their prices for the second consecutive month. The beverages and food sector led the output growth rankings in March despite a slight easing in the rate of expansion from February's nine-month high. Software and services registered the strongest rate of job creation in March, while automobiles and auto parts posted the sharpest reduction. And Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, reported that the EU28 seasonally adjusted current account of the balance of payments recorded a surplus of EUR38.6 billion ($43.3 billion), or 1.0% of GDP, in Q4 of 2018, up from a surplus of EUR36.2 billion, or 0.9% of GDP, in Q3 of 2018, and down from a surplus of EUR57.2 billion (1.5% of GDP) in Q4 of 2017. Compared with Q3 of 2018, based on seasonally adjusted data, the surplus of the goods account increased in Q4 of 2018 as did the surplus in the primary income account. The surplus of the services account fell, while the deficit of the secondary income account increased, as did the deficit of the capital account. In Q4, based on non-seasonally adjusted data, the EU28 recorded external current account surpluses with the US (+EUR67.7 billion), Switzerland (+EUR23.9 billion), Canada (+EUR9.5 billion), Brazil (+EUR5.9 billion), Hong Kong (+EUR5.7 billion), India (+EUR2.0 billion) and Japan (+EUR0.3 billion). Deficits were registered with China (-EUR28.5 billion) and Russia (-EUR13.3 billion). The highest surpluses were reported in Germany (+EUR67.6 billion), the Netherlands (+EUR27.5 billion), Italy (+EUR13.3 billion), France (+EUR7.1 billion) and Spain (+EUR6.6 billion). The largest deficits were in the UK(-EUR21.5 billion), Greece (-EUR3.9 billion), Belgium (-EUR3.8 billion), (Romania (-EUR2.2 billion) and Poland (-EUR1.8 billion). In the UK, the most recent KPMG and REC, UK Report on Jobs, showed that heightened uncertainty toward the outlook bolstered the fastest decline in permanent staff appointments since mid-2016 in March. Brexit related uncertainty also contributed to a further steep decline in staff availability. The report, which is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies, showed that permanent staff appointments fell for the second time in three months in March, and at the quickest rate since the aftermath of the Brexit referendum vote in July 2016. Concurrently, billings received from the employment of short-term staff rose at the second-slowest rate for two-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, UK House prices in Q1 were 2.6% higher than in the year-ago quarter, according to the Halifax House Price Index. Q1 house prices were 1.6% higher than in the preceding quarter. On a monthly basis, house prices fell by 1.6% to an average of Â£233,181. ""This reduction partly corrects the significant growth seen last month and again demonstrates the risk in focusing too heavily on short-term, volatile measures"" said Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax. ""Industry-wide figures show that the number of mortgages being approved remains around 40% below pre-financial crisis levels, and we know that lower levels of activity can lead to bigger price movements."" In Germany, production in industry was up 0.7% in February on the previous month on a price, seasonally and calendar adjusted basis, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis). In February, production in industry excluding energy and construction was down 0.2% month on month. Within industry, the production of capital goods increased 0.6%, while the production of intermediate goods decreased 0.6%, and production of consumer goods rose 1.6%.

174," GENEVA, April 5 (Reuters) - The United Nations torture investigator called on Ecuador on Friday not to expel Wikileaks founder Julian Assange from its London embassy, voicing concern that he could be extradited to the United States and possibly face mistreatment. A British friend said Assange was ""prepared"" for expulsion from the building he has lived in for nearly seven years, after Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno said he had ""repeatedly violated"" the terms of his asylum. Moreno told radio stations on Tuesday that Assange did not have the right to ""hack private accounts or phones"" and could not intervene in the politics of other countries, especially those with friendly relations with Ecuador. Nils Melzer, U.N. special rapporteur on torture, voiced concern that Assange's health was in ""serious decline"" and that, if he were expelled, he was likely to be arrested by British authorities and extradited to the United States. ""Such a response could expose him to a real risk of serious violations of his human rights, including his freedom of expression, his right to a fair trial and the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,"" he said. ""I therefore urge the Government of Ecuador to abstain from ...ceasing or suspending his political asylum until such time as the full protection of his human rights can be guaranteed."" Vaughan Smith, who hosted Assange at his country mansion for a year during his failed legal battle against extradition, said after visiting the Australian inside the embassy that the situation was ""very tense"". ""Julian doesn't know for sure but he's pretty convinced that at any moment he could be thrown out and he's prepared for it,"" Smith told reporters.  INVESTIGATIONS Assange took refuge in Ecuador'sLondon embassy in 2012 to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where authorities wanted to question him as part of a sexual assault investigation. That investigation was later dropped, but Assange fears he could be extradited to face charges in the United States, where federal prosecutors are investigating WikiLeaks. In a separate statement also issued in Geneva on Friday, the U.N. special rapporteur on the right to privacy, Joe Cannataci, said that he planned to meet Assange on April 25 ""after receiving assurances from the Government of Ecuador that it will facilitate his visit to the country's embassy in London"". Cannataci said the meeting would help determine ""if there exists a prima facie case of violation of privacy that warrants further investigation."" He was requesting further information from the Ecuadorean government on a complaint lodged by Moreno that his privacy had been violated by publication of illegally obtained personal data.

176," By Matt Scuffham NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank said it was open to further restructuring of its U.S. investment bank after Commerzbank executives sought clarity on its plans during merger talks, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The future of the bank's U.S. trading and investment banking presence had already been in question, with some shareholders calling for further cuts on top of ones announced last year. Speculation has intensified following confirmation of the merger talks last month. Commerzbank wanted reassurances Deutsche Bank was prepared to make deeper cuts at its loss-making U.S. business as a condition of proceeding with the merger talks, the sources said. The two banks have been in discussions on the potential deal over the past three weeks and a decision on whether to intensify or terminate the discussions is expected as early as this weekend, the sources said. It is unclear how many of the bank's 10,000 strong U.S. employees would be affected by any new cuts. Last year, the bank said it would reduce its global headcount to below 90,000 from 97,000. That included a 25 percent cut in equities sales and trading jobs, including a significant number in New York. In a research note published on Friday, analysts at KBW said Deutsche Bank could cut up to 15 percent of its investment banking staff globally, equivalent to around 2,500 jobs, to achieve cost savings required to make the deal work. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both declined to comment. David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors, which specializes in risk management, said he thinks the majority of the cuts would be outside Germany. ""If you want to reduce the pain for the staff in Germany, you have to cut more in New York and, maybe, London also. Deutsche Bank does not have a competitive advantage in investment banking in the United States,"" he said. Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Christian Sewing, said in a memo to staff last month the bank aimed to remain a global bank with a strong capital markets business. Commerzbank's chief executive, Martin Zielke, believes a strong and focused investment bank would be a good addition to the lender, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The German government, which has pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion, wants the combined business to retain an investment bank capable of supporting German companies doing business around the world, the sources said. A tie-up between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank would give the combined bank a dominant position in its domestic market and improve its cost of funding. However, some analysts believe the deal fails to address Deutsche Bank's biggest problem, its underperforming and capital-intensive U.S. investment bank. Commerzbank has limited investment banking operations so there are few opportunities to generate cost savings in that part of the bank, leaving Deutsche Bank still striving to turn around a business that has weighed on its earnings. After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street, even as European rivals like Credit Suisse made big cuts. Deutsche Bank's U.S. business has brought in around half of revenue for its overall investment banking unit, which includes corporate and investment banking as well as trading. However, the business, encumbered by litigation and regulatory investigations into past misconduct, has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals. ",24.17999999999938,1
177," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Name your favorite celebrity? I bet they have a pot brand. Gone are the days of hawking wine and luxury goods to make an extra buck. The rise of cannabis has attracted movie stars, musicians, politicians, athletes, and people from many other backgrounds looking to put their stamp on the burgeoning industry. Many of the partnerships sprouting up between Hollywood and the cannabis industry are with publicly traded companies. As a result, some celebrities are getting wealthy off pot stocks. Who are they? Well, if you take a look at this list of 20 Celebrities Who Are Marijuana Enthusiasts , several are already involved in the cannabis industry. I've taken some of the people on that list, added a few not mentioned, and created a list of five celebrities who could be in line for an outstanding payday should their pot stocks continue to move higher.   When you think of celebrities and pot, Snoop would be on most people's list. The two go hand in hand. Snoop has been in a partnership with Canopy Growth (NYSE:
CGC
), Canada's largest cannabis company by market cap, since October 2016 . Canopy's Tweed Shop online store is selling Snoop's Leafs by Snoop brand. To celebrate the occasion, Snoop threw a private party in Toronto for his new friends. Since then, Snoop's cannabis interests have taken off. In March 2018 , Snoop's Casa Verde Capital raised $45 million in venture capital to invest in the cannabis industry. Recently, the musician connected his TV pal Martha Stewart with Canopy Growth CEO Bruce Linton. Stewart is working with the company to create a line of hemp-derived CBD pet products. ""I think it's a starting spot that was comfortable for everyone involved. We have the science and she's a lifelong dog, horse, animal person,"" Linton said in early March. ""This just seemed like a really balanced and suitable starting point."" Snoop and Martha. Together again.   The Canopy Growth list of celebrity partners got a little longer March 29 when Canadian actor and comedian Seth Rogen and screenwriter Evan Goldberg announced a partnership with the company. The duo's brand is called Houseplant. After working together on the film Pineapple Express, Rogen and Goldberg created the Toronto-based company along with some other friends and colleagues. ""We could not be more passionate about this company and are dedicated to doing everything the right way,"" stated Rogen. ""It is extremely important to us to treat cannabis with the reverence it deserves. What a time!"" Although no specific financial details were given, Canopy has acquired 25% of Houseplant, invested some working capital, and will provide the facilities to grow. For Canopy's part, it was careful to point out that its new partners aren't just figurehead, but actual business owners who've spent the past five years preparing to launch the company. Its first product is Houseplant Sativa. It will initially be sold in B.C., rolling out across Canada after that. Pre-rolled joints and softgels will follow later in 2019. All products will be grown and produced at Canopy's facilities in Smith's Falls, Ontario, where Canopy is based.  Source: Shutterstock  I don't know how many Americans are familiar with the Trailer Park Boys: Ricky, Bubbles, and Julian. However, in Canada, their show ran on an off for close to 20 years . A crazy show that never was expected to go anywhere, the Trailer Park Boys have turned into a global following. It's for this reason that New Brunswick-based cannabis company OrganiGram (OTCMKTS:
OGRMF
) partnered with the Nova Scotia trio in November 2016 to produce Trailer Park Buds recreational pot at the company's facility in Moncton. ""This relationship solidifies one of our strategic building blocks as we plan for the legalization of recreational use in Canada. The team at Trailer Park Boys have an aligned vision to develop a National brand with our assistance and we're incredibly excited at how the partnership will come to life,"" Ray Gracewood, Chief Commercial Officer at OrganiGram, said at the time. The interesting piece of this partnership is that the marketing rules surrounding recreational pot in Canada are so stringent, Trailer Park Buds almost didn't pass the sniff test. Under regulations, endorsements, sponsorships, testimonials aren't allowed. Neither are promotions appealing to youth or associating with a particular lifestyle. Luckily, almost two years of work didn't end up on the cutting room floor when recreational pot became legal last October. OtganiGram's Gracewood commented at the time of legalization that there was enough of a distance between the Trailer Park Boys and Trailer Park Buds to get the green light from Health Canada. That's excellent news for shareholders.   I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day. The words of Kiss' most successful song roll off the tongue keeping lead singer Gene Simmons in a very comfortable California lifestyle. A natural marketer and businessman, Simmons sensed Cannabis was going to be big and inserted himself into the industry by agreeing to become Invictus MD Strategies' (OTCMKTS:
IVITF
) chief evangelist in March 2018. ""Three years ago, I was dismissive, arrogant and uninformed about medical cannabis and thought the whole notion of its medical uses as so much smoke and mirrors,"" Simmons said in July 2018. ""But over the last few years, I've started to see the tremendous new information that scientists and researchers have been telling us about the incredible uses for this humble plant that just grows there in the ground. I'm incredibly bullish on the product and, particularly, on this company."" Unfortunately, while Simmons was high on Invictus, investors don't appear to be high on Simmons or the company. Its stock is down 34% since Invictus and the Kiss frontman announced their relationship. However, Invictus paid him $2.5 million in cash, issued 2.6 million shares, with another four million shares to be issued in the future, so he's got $10 million reasons to get its stock price over $1.   The Tragically Hip is one of Canada's favorite bands. Its lead singer, Gord Downie, died of cancer at the age of 53 in October 2017. The band first partnered with Newstrike Brands (OTCMKTS:
NWKRF
) in May 2017 before Downie passed away. Not only did the members of the band invest in Newstrike, but they also agreed to partner with Newstrike in preparation of the legalization of cannabis in Canada. The band did its due diligence at the time and felt Newstrike had all the right ingredients from a scientific perspective to feel comfortable attaching the Tragically Hip name to the company. More than two years later, Quebec-based Hexo (NASDAQ:
HEXO
) swept in, agreeing to buy Newstrike for $260 million in HEXO stock. Each Newstrike shareholder will get 0.06332 of a HEXO share for every Newstrike share. Hexo acquired Newstrike in part because of the Tragically Hip but also because the company has a partnership with Toronto food company Neal Brothers to produce specialty edibles. That will be very popular with Canadians. Not sure how many shares the Tragically Hip have in Newstrike, but if I were them, I'd keep the HEXO shares they get in the takeover because Hexo's other deal with Molson Coors (NYSE:
TAP
) looks to be a good one. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. The post 5 Celebrities Making Money Off Pot Stocks appeared first on InvestorPlace . ",24.17999999999938,1
178," Getting your credit score today is easy - just turn to your bank, credit card issuer or one of the many apps and websites out there. That means millennials, unlike their parents, have the advantage of early insight into their financial profiles. But looking isn't enough. Without knowing the basics of credit, looking at your data is like having the pieces to a puzzle, but not understanding how they fit together. Here's what to know. You have multiple credit scores , not just one. Those scores vary, depending on: Lenders may pull different versions of your scores than you see, and you cannot always know which one they use for approval decisions, says Katherine Lucas McKay, program manager in the financial security program at the Aspen Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. You cannot control what score lenders use, but you can control how you manage credit. Fortunately, a small set of good credit habits have the power to benefit all of your scores. Paying your bills on time and using less than 30% of your available credit limits (the lower the better) will help build a strong score, regardless of the scoring model. That's because FICO and VantageScore both emphasize having a good payment history and low credit usage when calculating scores. To accurately track how your credit is doing, make sure you're looking at the same score (FICO or VantageScore) generated using data from the same credit report. When it comes to credit, common misconceptions get in the way of building good habits. One persistent myth: Checking your own score hurts it. ""You're not going to lose points for looking at your credit,"" says Angela Moore, a certified financial planner at Modern Money Advisor in Miami. Checking your own score triggers a ""soft"" pull on your credit but doesn't affect your score. A ""hard"" pull, on the other hand, occurs when you apply for a loan or a landlord asks to scrutinize your credit, for example. Hard pulls also go on your credit reports and can temporarily knock a few points off your score. Moore says another misconception is that utility and cell phone payments help credit. Managing those bills responsibly is necessary, she says, but they don't affect your score - unless you forget to pay. Say you move out of a shared apartment and leave the power bill in your name. If your former roommates don't make payments, the account could end up in collections and damage your credit. To prevent such surprises, use free services to scan your reports for accounts you don't recognize or forgot were open, Moore says. Also check your detailed credit reports from annualcreditreport.com; you're entitled to one free annual report from each bureau. ""Credit should be used cautiously and strategically when needed and not because you feel forced,"" Moore says. Don't take on more debt than you can handle just to build a score. Scoring models consider the mix and number of accounts you have, but that matters much less than paying on time and keeping credit usage low. Making student or auto loan payments is enough to maintain a decent score, Moore says. Credit cards are convenient, and many offer rewards, but if you cannot pay off monthly balances, you might pile up debt. A TD Bank survey released in March found that nearly a third of millennials surveyed didn't pay their cards off in full each month. They may be falling for another credit myth, that keeping a balance is good for your score. It isn't. If an issuer offers you an increase, think carefully before accepting, says Lucas McKay. ""If you use it just to increase your available credit but keep your spending the same, that's great. But if not, then think about how much more you are likely to spend with that increase.""

179," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In the stock market, as in many other arenas of life, risk and reward usually go together. The riskier an investment, the bigger the potential payoff. Likewise, the less risky an investment, the smaller the payoff. Consequently, if you're looking for big potential returns in the stock market, you have to be ""OK"" with absorbing big potential risk. To be sure, the best investments in the stock market are ones that mitigate risk and maximize return, and have a positive risk/reward profile. But mitigating risk often comes with diluting potential return. Thus, the biggest winners are often stocks that, at one point in time, were considered very risky. Case in point: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:
AMD
). In early 2018, AMD stock was considered very risky. It was a barely profitable semiconductor company with a long history of operational turbulence, and the stock was trading at nosebleed multiples relative to peers. Yet, the company continued to fire on all cylinders, and AMD stock turned into the best-performing S&P 500 stock in 2018. Consequently, for investors looking for big potential returns in Q2, I've put together a list of seven high risk, high rewards trades for the next three months. To be sure, these trades aren't for the faint of heart. They have big risks. But, they also have big return potential, and that's why they could be of interest to risk-on traders.   The Rewards: Shares of China luxury electric vehicle maker NIO (NYSE:
NIO
) have been ice cold ever since the company announced disappointing fourth-quarter numbers, which included signs of a demand slowdown in January and February 2019. NIO stock has lost about half of its value in a month. This sell-off seems overdone. Delivery volume picked back up in March, implying that weak January/February numbers were an anomaly. If so, and if the numbers remain good throughout the year, NIO stock could rally in a big way over the next several months as optimism returns to the stock. The Risks: China's economy is slowing, electric vehicle competition in China is increasing, and NIO doesn't have a long track record to prove resilience to macro risk factors (the company started delivering vehicles mid-way through 2018). As such, there are many reasons to believe that the numbers will continue to slow throughout 2019. If so, NIO stock won't go higher. Instead, given its still-premium valuation, the stock will only go lower if the delivery numbers don't turn around.   Rewards: If you're shorting shares of social media company Snap (NYSE:
SNAP
), you should know they have been on fire ever since the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, which put an end to user base erosion and paved a path for healthy growth over the next several years. Over the past three-plus months, the stock has more than doubled. That means big expectations are priced in ahead of the company's next earnings report, due at the end of April. Specifically, investors expect continued user base growth, and if they don't get that (they might not, given adverse search trends which imply Instagram is still eating Snap's lunch), the stock could collapse in a big way . Risks:  SNAP stock has a lot upward momentum, and stepping in the way of momentum is always a risky and tough thing to do. As of last quarter, all the important trends were moving in Snap's direction, including user growth, unit revenue growth, gross margins and overall profitability. If those positive trends show up again in the April earnings report, then SNAP stock will not just hold onto its big gains, but also add to them as investors hop on the momentum train.  Rewards:  Many investors have put meal kit maker Blue Apron (NYSE:
APRN
) in the ""dead and gone"" category, and the stock price appropriately reflects this (right around $1 per share). But, the meal kit space isn't a bad one, and secular trends in the on-demand and at-home economies imply that the space has healthy growth potential over the next several years. It's a highly competitive space. Blue Apron won't be the king. But, under the right management, Blue Apron could be a relevant player in the space. Importantly, the company just switched out its CEO, and tapped the former COO of Etsy (NASDAQ:
ETSY
) to run the company. That's a good hire (Etsy knows a thing or two about turnarounds), and makes an APRN stock turnaround from here seem more likely than ever before. Risks:  The bull thesis in APRN stock hinges entirely on new management figuring out how to stabilize sales erosion while concurrently cutting costs and improving profitability. That's a tall order. As of last quarter, revenues were dropping by over 20% and the company was still running wide losses. Thus, new management needs to do a lot to turn this ship around. It's not impossible, but it will be tough.   Rewards:  Ride-sharing giant Lyft (NASDAQ:
LYFT
) has had a tough start on Wall Street. But, this is a very big company, growing very quickly, with shared dominance in a North American ride-sharing market that is only scratching the surface of its at-scale potential. Long term, Lyft has clarity to one day morph into an $80 billion ride-sharing giant . The company has a valuation of just $20 billion today. Consequently, long term upside looks compelling, and investors should start to see that long-term upside once this near term panic fades. Risks:  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, stepping in the way of momentum is a risky and tough thing to do. Right now, LYFT stock has a lot of downward momentum, as everyone has bought into this thesis that the IPO valuation was unsustainable. So long as this thesis remains front-and-center, LYFT stock will likely remain weak. No one really knows when this thesis will fade from the spotlight. As such, downside risk in the near term remains very real.  Rewards:  In the intro, I mentioned that AMD stock was the S&P 500's top stock in 2018. Interestingly enough, it's also one of the S&P 500's top-five stocks thus far in 2019. It has become increasingly clear that AMD is successfully expanding its relatively small CPU and GPU market share, so the ""David turning into Goliath"" thesis here is gaining traction. Because AMD is a $30 billion company, and its peers are $100 billion-plus companies, so long as that thesis remains alive and well, AMD stock will have plenty of room to run higher. Risks:  At current levels, the biggest risk with AMD stock is valuation. The stock trades at a nosebleed valuation, and even under aggressive long-term growth assumptions, the most aggressive price target I can get to for fiscal 2019 is around $27 . Thus, this big 2018/19 rally does appear to be living on borrowed time. The stock is due to drop in a big way on any bad news. Will that bad news come within the next few months? No one knows, but the big valuation does imply big risk.   Rewards:  All pot stocks have been in rally mode in 2019, but none quite as much as Cronos (NASDAQ:
CRON
), which could make for an interesting short. At one point in time, the smallest of the Big 4 Canadian cannabis stocks was up 120% year-to-date. That rally has since been faded following disappointing fourth-quarter numbers . CRON stock now trades more than 20% off its 2019 highs. This drop should continue over the next several months. On almost every metric, CRON stock is about as expensive as it gets in the cannabis space, and the recent quarterly numbers underscore that this premium valuation isn't warranted. Thus, until the next earnings report rolls around, the recent downtrend in CRON stock should persist. Risks:  The risks associated with shorting CRON stock are essentially the same risks that arise when you short any cannabis stock. This is a highly volatile industry that is subject to both big drops on bad news and big rallies on good news. Right now, the news flow in the cannabis space is largely positive, mostly thanks to a robust legal Canadian market growth, a healthy U.S. legalization progress and a ton of investment and M&A activity. If this positive news flow persists, then CRON stock may be able to buck its recent downtrend, and catch a ride higher with the rest of the pot sector.   Rewards:  Memory chip maker Micron (NASDAQ:
MU
) has been hammered over the past several months amid deteriorating supply/demand fundamentals in its core memory markets. Specifically, a slowdown in global economic expansion and a rise in trade and FX headwinds has diluted memory market demand, while supply has been building for a long time and inventories now sit at 25-year highs . This has created downward pressure on revenues and margins. But, MU stock now trades at just 9 times forward earnings, and there's reason to believe that - given global economic stabilization, aggressive first quarter semiconductor market inventory clearing, and global trade and FX improvements - the worst is in the rear-view mirror. If so, MU stock could explode higher from here. Risks:  There's nothing in the numbers which supports this bull thesis. Specifically, gross margins are still in free fall, so this turnaround is all speculative based on the idea that semiconductor market fundamentals are getting better globally. Until these improvements show up in the numbers, MU stock will likely remain weaker for longer. As of this writing, Luke Lango was long NIO and LYFT.

180," By Marcelo Rochabrun SAO PAULO, April 5 (Reuters) - A new plan by cash-strapped carrier Avianca Brasil to sell its most coveted airport slots to Brazil's two largest airlines will draw intense antitrust scrutiny, which may delay or derail a pressing cash injection. Antitrust regulator CADE said on Friday that it could block the plan, which Avianca Brasil hopes could raise some $210 million later this month. The airline filed for bankruptcy protection in December. Representatives for LATAM, Avianca Brasil and Gol did not respond to requests for comment. Avianca Brasil's plan would raise much-needed funds but is high-risk, lawyers said, and could leave it hanging without quick cash. Creditors will vote later on Friday whether to approve the plan which would allow Gol and LATAM to bid on the assets. Avianca Brasil would not receive any funds until CADE greenlights the operation, said antitrust lawyer Tatiana Lins Cruz in an interview on Thursday. She said CADE could take up to eight months to analyze a case in which buyers already control more than 20 percent of a given market. Meanwhile, the airline would have to continue operations with its own money. But Avianca Brasil has been so cash-strapped that it fell behind its payroll in March. A person familiar with LATAM's thinking said the airlines hoped CADE would approve the deals because they only involve a modest increase in their presence at Brazil's busiest airports.  AZUL SIDELINED The new plan is a setback for rival Azul SA, which ranks as Brazil's third largest airline and has a small presence in those three airports. In Sao Paulo's domestic Congonhas airport, Gol and LATAM already control a combined 92 percent of the slots, whereas Azul has just 3 percent. Azul had struck a preliminary deal with Avianca Brasil to take over the slots for $105 million and had already provided some $8 million so the carrier could meet its March payroll. But that deal was off once Gol and LATAM came in. CADE appeared to take a more positive view of an Azul takeover on Friday. ""A scenario where Azul becomes the buyer represents a lower antitrust concern than in a scenario with LATAM or Gol,"" the regulator said in its report. The plan could also draw scrutiny from Brazil's civil aviation regulator, because airport slots are not meant to be bought and sold. Azul was planning to buy Avianca Brasil's assets as a single airline, but the new plan would create seven different companies, each holding little more than slots. ""In our view, it is not clear whether the Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) will approve this new structure,"" wrote analysts at Brazil bank Bradesco BBI in a note to clients.

181," Wall Street kicks off the second quarter of 2019 on an upbeat mood instigated by easing trade tensions. Though the S&P 500 Index logged its biggest first-quarter gain since 1998 , there was quite a tumult in the market in March mainly on recessionary jitters in the United States, acute fear of slowdown in the Euro zone and Brexit drama. This makes it easier for the global market to engage in a rally to start Q2 thanks to progress in trade talks, manufacturing revival in the United States and China and hopes of a soft Brexit. Against this backdrop, we highlight a few ETFs that are well-positioned at the current level and still have legs. Vanguard Industrials Index Fund ETF Shares VIS It seems the industrial sector is coming back to life slowly. Reflecting decent U.S. economic growth, the Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing PMI in the United States increased to 55.3 in March from February's 54.2. The reading also surpassed market expectations of 54.5 (read: U.S. Manufacturing Sector Grows in March: ETF & Stock Picks ). China's all-important and long-ailing manufacturing sector is also showing signs of improvement. The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 in March 2019 from 49.9 in the prior month, beating market expectations of 50.1 (read: What Led China ETFs Outperform in Q1 & Have More Room to Run ). Along with the gradually improving global sentiments, a dovish Fed and receding trade tensions should push this already soaring Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ETF higher. SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR The first-quarter 2019 earnings growth is expected to turn negative, per Earnings Trends issued on Apr 3, 2019 . This would mark the firs t earnings decline since the second quarter of 2016. Margin pressure has acted as a headwind as revenues continue to grow. Against this backdrop, very few sectors are projected to post positive earnings growth in Q1, among which Aerospace is expected to have the best growth rate of 4.5%. Also, President Donald Trump unveiled his third budget proposal for fiscal 2020, which begins on Oct 1, 2019. The record $4.75 trillion budget proposal seeks to bolster funding for defense and border walls. All these factors make XAR a good pick. The fund has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) (read: After a Lull, Will Defense-Related ETFs Surge Ahead? ). Xtrackers MSCI China A Inclusion Equity ETF ASHX The underlying index of the fund - the MSCI China A Inclusion Index is designed to track the progressive partial inclusion of A shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index over time. Investors should note that MSCI is allowing investors greater access to the  world's second-largest stock market: China .

The S&P 500 has just seen the  best quarterly gain since 2009 . After the astounding gains, thoughts of overvaluation concerns are justified. Also, global growth worries make it wise to hone in on value quotient when it comes to large-cap investing (the capitalization has considerable international exposure). Per an article published on seekingalpha, ""value stocks are now  at the deepest discount to growth  since 2000,"" ideally offering a good buying point. Alerian MLP ETF AMLP Oil prices have staged a rebound this year, coming off a steep sell-off late last year. This in turn resulted in a surge in related investments like MLP ETFs. The fund AMLP is up 15.8% this year, beating the S&P 500 and yielding as high as 7.88% currently.

But rather than host the event in person, the organizers adopted a core tenet of the Lightning Network itself into the very fabric of Bolt-A-Thon . ""The Lightning Network was built around the idea of financial inclusivity,"" explained Andrew Yang, the COO at BlockFuse and an event organizer. ""Anyone in the world can pay and it can be done pseudonymously … As the world's first online Lightning Network and hackathon, that's exactly what the Bolt-A-Thon was designed to be."" By creating a borderless, affordable event that people could attend anonymously, the team behind Bolt-A-Thon is hoping to draw the very attendees who are central to both the growth of the Lightning Network and the development of Bitcoin in general. ""We are strong believers in the Lightning Network but recognize that there is still lots of room to grow,"" Yang said. ""We hope that the Bolt-A-Thon makes the Lightning Network more accessible to more people and inspires even more developers all around the world to get involved."" The Bolt-A-Thon hackathon will begin on the evening of April 5 and run until April 7, 2019. Hackers will be given a suggested theme for their work and will build their projects over the two and a half days, culminating in a presentation to their fellow hackers and a panel of judges. Anyone in the world is eligible to participate and there are BTC prizes for the top projects. The conference, which begins on April 6, includes a lineup of Lightning-focused speakers like Rusty Russell from Blockstream, Conner Fromknecht from Lightning Labs and Fabrice Drouin from ACINQ. Each speaker session will be held at a cost of $10, according to the organizers, and payments will be processed via the Lightning Network. This will include submarine swaps and submarine atomic swaps, making Bolt-A-Thon itself a stress test for the Lightning Network.",24.17999999999938,1
183," By Eduardo Simões and Jamie McGeever CAMPOS DO JORDAO, Brazil, April 5 (Reuters) - The challenge facing Brazilian lawmakers of reforming the country's social security system to put public finances back on track is huge, but one they are meeting head on, finance minister Paulo Guedes said on Friday. Presenting an image of unity with some of the key congressional figures whose support he needs to help build the political consensus required to secure approval, Guedes said commitment to pension reform across the spectrum is solid. Guedes has cut a divisive figure on the government's signature economic reform proposal, which aims to save over 1 trillion reais over the next decade, and was embroiled in an acrimonious congressional committee hearing with opposition lawmakers this week. But alongside Senate President Davi Alcolumbre, lower house speaker Rodrigo Maia and the government's chief congressional whip, Joice Hasselmann, he insisted that he has the full support of President Jair Bolsonaro and other political leaders. ""My experience with the political class has been the best possible, super-constructive,"" Guedes said at an event in Campos do Jordao in the state of Sao Paulo. Alcolumbre said it is vital that the president lead the push for pension reform, but said he must listen to party leaders' concerns. Bolsonaro met with five party leaders this week and will have more meetings next week, Joice said. Increasingly public political back-biting over pension reform sparked a steep fall in Brazilian markets in late March, but they have settled this week on signs that political leaders are trying to come together. Reaching out to lawmakers, negotiating and looking for consensus suggests Bolsonaro is being forced to resort to the traditional political methods he had condemned during the election campaign. Guedes on Friday reiterated his view that pension reform will be approved by the lower house before the end of June, while Maia said delay of a few weeks will be immaterial because the economic impact will be felt next year. A split between Bolsonaro and Guedes over private retirement accounts appeared to emerge, however, after the president told journalists that he could drop the plan if it runs into opposition in Congress, the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper reported. Guedes has been a vigorous defender of the idea. ",24.17999999999938,1

189," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It looks grim, on the surface. Just five months apart, two new 737 MAX passenger jets from Boeing (NYSE
:BA
) crashed, claiming the lives of 346. The plane was not only supposed to be hyper-efficient, but safe. The two crashes suggest a flaw in the software that automates control of the plane.  Shareholders paid the price. Just days after Boeing stock had soared to record-high values, the March 10 incident in Ethiopia pulled the rug out from underneath that rally. BA stock fell from $416 per share to a low near $362 just a couple of weeks later. There's a reason, however, shares have since snapped back to a price around $395 despite the backdrop of damning headlines. The market knows, as tragic as the matter has been, Boeing can dig its way out of its publicity hole. Interested investors might want to go ahead and pull the trigger now. The precise causes for both crashes have not been firmly identified, but the commonalities are uncanny. In both cases, flight control problems were reported . The planes' internal safety system was apparently trying to avoid stalling by pushing the nose of the plane down, but pilots in both cases were deliberately trying to point the nose of the plane up. There's plenty of blame to go around, most of which admittedly falls in Boeing's lap. While the 737 MAX's flight control system is arguably superior, it's also confusing. Pilots who've not been trained on this particular plane and control system may not respond as prescribed , but Boeing arguably should have recognized most pilots wouldn't be able to train as merited. At the same time, experience and training requirements overseas aren't nearly as stringent as they are in the United States. One could even say the Federal Aviation Administration's certification process of the 737 MAX was inadequate . And, people have said it. Still, it's Boeing's highly-touted plane that's become a liability. It will deal with the fallout more than any other. It will deal with the fallout though. The airframe and physical design of the aircraft has never been in question, and a fix to the plane's software is in development . That's relatively easy. It's not as if companies haven't been in similar or worse situations before. Take Tex-Mex eatery Chipotle (NYSE:
CMG
) for instance. It was the epicenter of an E. coli outbreak in late 2015 was handled horribly. Although it took years to regroup and rebuild, CMG stock is less than 10% away from its record-high set in mid-2015. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:
JNJ
) got past its cyanide-laced Tylenol. General Motors (NYSE:
GM
) overcame several fatalities linked to faulty ignitions switches . That said, Boeing may not be handling the gaffe quite as well as it could, showing its inexperience with public relations challenges of this ilk. According to public relations firm kglobal's partner Gene Grabowski : Even so, public relations experts see a light at the end of the tunnel, even if that light is distant. ""Boeing is going to survive, but they're not going to look good in the short term,"" said Eric Dezenhall, CEO of public relations firm Dezenhall Resources. ""They have the leadership, the resources, and the diversification to survive. What I always tell clients in these situations is, 'Don't look for praise anytime soon.'"" ""Soon"" is a relative matter though, and stocks tend to move in advance of measurable strength or weakness. And that's what makes the past couple of weeks such interesting ones. As time passed, Boeing's software was narrowed down as the core culprit in the pair of crashes. Boeing stock rebounded anyway, gaining nearly 9% from its March low. BA stock made the gain despite what Grabowski estimated to be an adverse fiscal impact of between $30 billion and $40 billion. It's possible the market is wrong, misreading how quickly airlines and consumers will forgive and forget once the planes' new software is in place. Possible, but not likely. More often than not, when investors collectively trade against the grain of headlines, they know what they're doing. More turbulence is undoubtedly ahead, but Boeing stock remains one of the market's top long-term prospects. Demand for air travel is still on the cusp of major growth that will double the number of airworthy planes between now and 2036 . As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Boeing.

As part of its growing ad business, Snap announced the Snap Audience Network, an ad network that will allow it to run ads in other apps. The most prominent digital advertising businesses utilize ad networks to expand their reach and ad-targeting capabilities. The Snap Audience Network is potentially the most important of the announcements, as the core Snapchat platform has seemingly peaked in terms of user growth . Lacking user growth, launching an ad network could allow Snap to continue growing its advertising business outside of Snapchat. However, analyst reactions were mixed. Morgan Stanley analysts believe the new offerings have potential but ""material monetization of this new engagement is not as straightforward,"" opting to keep a sell rating and $5.50 price target. Stifel has a neutral rating and $10 price target, with analysts saying the announcements showed Snap can still innovate. Summit Insights upgraded Snap shares from sell to hold while doubling its price target from $5 to $10. Bank of America Merrill Lynch kept its neutral rating but increased its price target from $10 to $12. Overall, analysts were cautiously optimistic about the news, recognizing the potential while waiting to see if Snap can execute.  10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.

192," By Muvija M April 5 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 held firmly at its six-month high, marking a strong finish to the week as better-than-expected U.S. jobs data eased fears of a global economic slowdown while the pound weakened on growing Brexit jitters and lifted exporters. The blue-chip index advanced 0.6 percent, outshining its European peers and recording its biggest weekly gain in two months, while the midcaps rose 0.2 percent as weakness in the local currency capped gains. Miners followed suit, with a 0.8 percent rise as they found their support in higher Zinc prices. The FTSE 100 was already cheery as international companies rose on expectations that a China-U.S. trade dispute could be nearing an end, with President Donald Trump saying a deal could be reached in about four weeks. Financial heavyweights with a larger exposure to Asian markets, such as HSBC and Prudential, were among the biggest boosts. The blue-chips, which earn 70 percent of their profits in the U.S. dollar, got a boost from sterling, which weakened as doubts mounted over British Prime Minister Theresa May's attempt to further delay Brexit. May wrote to Brussels asking to delay Britain's EU exit date until the end of June to allow lawmakers to agree a withdrawal deal, but Donald Tusk, who chairs EU summits, has proposed a longer postponement of one year. Dublin's main index, considered a gauge of Brexit fears, jumped 1.1 percent to levels not seen since October. ""Irish stocks were under pressure recently and it has been overly priced in that a no-deal Brexit is going to happen. I think it is more of a relief rally for Irish stocks,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. A sour spot on the UK markets were housebuilders, which slumped 1 percent after data from mortgage lender Halifax showed that house prices dipped last month. Prices have been under pressure as Britons have held back on buying homes due to Brexit uncertainties. The price drop ""was an unpleasant reminder to the sector over what is at stake, and potentially a tease for a nastier drop if the UK does crash out of the European Union without an agreement in place"", Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said. The sector has lost 2 percent since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, heavily underperforming a 17 percent gain in the FTSE 100 over the same period. Among midcaps, power generator ContourGlobal jumped 7 percent after hiking its dividend for 2018, while Funding Circle slumped 8 percent after saying it plans to close its listed fund Funding Circle SME Income Fund.

195," By Lamine Chikhi and Hamid Ould Ahmed ALGIERS, April 5 (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of protesters demanding radical change marched through Algiers for a seventh successive Friday, as Algeria's spy chief was reportedly fired in a further sign of high-level turbulence after the veteran president resigned. The demonstrators are pushing for the removal of what they see as an outdated and opaque political apparatus, built around the ruling party, army officers, businessmen, unions and veterans of a 1954-62 independence war against France. ""We want to uproot the symbols of the system,"" said teacher Ahmed Badili, as hundreds of people waved national flags from the balconies of buildings. Others handed out sweets and bottled water. The intelligence chief, retired army general Athmane Tartag, was a close ally of president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who quit on Tuesday under pressure from the army. The military said it was acting in the national interest after weeks of largely peaceful anti-government demonstrations. Western powers are eager for stability in the OPEC oil producer, Africa's largest country by land massand a key gas supplier for Europe and partner to fight militants. Bouteflika's departure has not eased tensions despite the appointment of a caretaker government which will stay in office until elections in three months' time. This Friday, protesters pushed for the removal of Prime Minister Nouredine Bedoui, upper house of parliament chairman Abdelkader Bensalah, and Tayeb Belaiz, head of the constitutional council -- all seen as establishment figures. Many banners read ""3B's must go."" In the weeks before his resignation, Bouteflika's inner circle had already been depleted by the exit of several close allies from influential positions in politics and business. Tartag's departure was reported by the private Ennahar TV, and two political sources confirmed that he had been sacked. Ennahar added that his position would return to the supervision of the defence ministry, rather than the presidency, a move that appears to strengthen the army's hand. The intelligence service has in the past been an important part of the military's influence in national affairs, and played a backroom role in politics as well as in the 1990s civil war. But in 2016, Bouteflika removed it from the supervision of the defence ministry and placed it under the authority of the presidency to try to ease it out of the political sphere. Protesters want to remove any traces of the old guard and introduce sweeping democratic reforms. But no clear successor to Bouteflika has yet emerged and Algeria's opposition is fragmented. The uncertainty means the army is likely to continue playing its role as kingmaker with little resistance, guiding the sensitive transition process. Unlike in past protests, when some Algerians said the army should not interfere in civilian matters, there were signs of support for the military in the latest demonstration. Some banners said ""the people and the army are brothers."" Some protesters saw humour in Algeria's crisis: ""Any country interested in toppling its system, we are ready to help. Please send a copy of the constitution. You also need an appointment and we only work on Friday,"" read one banner. ",24.17999999999938,1
196," JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Reuters) - South Africa's rand firmed on Friday, ending the first week of the new quarter more than two percent firmer as slow wage growth in the United States helped maintain demand for emerging currencies. Stocks gained on the back of a possible trade deal between the U.S. and China. At 1530 GMT the rand was 0.32 percent firmer at 14.0675 per dollar from 14.1125 on Thursday. Signs of progress in trade talks between China and the U.S. has bolstered demand for emerging market currencies in general but the main boost for South African assets this week came from Moody's holding the country's sovereign rating at investment grade. The rand's run towards 14.00 could unlock further gains, analysts said, with the cluster of stop-loss triggers around the level adding momentum to the rally before an expected spike in volatility as May 8 national elections approach. A Reuters poll taken this week found the rand is likely to remain steady at 14.30 over the next six months. In equities, the Johannesburg All-Share index gained by the 0.11 percent to 57,776 points, while the Top-40 index rose 0.13 percent to 51,518 points. ""For the most part, resources led the charge on the way up today. All of the gold staples were up. We've seen the market looking for quality at the moment, and the likes of Sibanye Gold were sharply up,"" said Independent Securities trader Ryan Woods. The gold index strengthened 1.41 percent, while the platinum basket gained rose by 1.22 percent. Sibanye Gold advanced 2.51 percent to 16,35 rand. Anglo American Platinum climbed 0.9 percent to 795,06 rand. In fixed income, the benchmark 2026 government bond firmed, with the yield down 2.5 basis points to 8.51 percent. ",24.17999999999938,1

198," At Zacks, we try to avoid labeling stocks as ""cheap"" or ""expensive."" Instead, we opt to look beyond a stock's face value, and our system puts an emphasis on earnings estimate revisions to find stocks that will hopefully be winners for investors. With that said, low-priced stocks can still be attractive to investors as they present the chance to take a larger position in a company, which they might not be able to in higher-priced stocks. When searching for these low-priced stocks, we still look for similar trends in growth, value, and momentum. Then we apply the Zacks Rank to properly analyze the potential that these companies have. Today we've highlighted five stocks that are currently trading for under $10 per share. All of these stocks also sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or better, and are showing signs of outpacing the market.

199," By Roberta Rampton CALEXICO, Calif., April 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday promised approximately 450 miles (725 km) of new ""wall"" along the southern U.S. border, after threatening to slap Mexico with an unspecified economic penalty to crack down on what he describes as a crisis of undocumented immigration and drug trafficking. Referring to a ""colossal surge"" of immigrants, Trump convened a discussion with immigration officials and local leaders in Calexico on the U.S.-Mexico border just north of the much larger city of Mexicali. ""Our country is full,"" Trump said in a warning to migrants. ""Can't take you anymore. The Republican president's latest pronouncements, including a threat to impose auto tariffs on Mexico, are in response to a rising number of migrants, many of them families with children, traveling northward from Central America through Mexico and to the U.S. border. During Friday's discussion in Calexico, Trump was handed a diamond-shaped piece of steel slate - the material used to construct barriers along the border. Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said that by the end of next year - just after the November 2020 presidential election - about 450 miles (725 km) of new barrier will be completed. Border officials have said they need 722 miles (1,162 km) of new or replacement barriers. Trump is counting on seizing funds from other federal accounts and shifting them for the construction, a move being challenged in federal court because Congress has not given approval. Democrats generally oppose Trump's wall proposal, suggesting instead other types of enhanced border security that they argue would be more effective and less costly. Hammering on a favorite theme, Trump earlier on Friday said he was considering imposing an unspecified economic penalty on Mexico unless it helps alleviate the United States' drug and immigrant flows. Although Trump has several times linked the issues of illegal immigration and drug smuggling as he tries to tighten border security, much of the drug trade is not carried out by migrants but by professional crime gangs that send narcotics to the United States in vehicles through official ports of entry. Praising Mexico for moving recently against drug traffickers, Trump said, ""If they continue that, everything will be fine. If they don't we're going to tariff their cars at 25 percent."" ""Also, I'm looking at an economic penalty for all of the drugs that are coming in through the southern border and killing our people,"" Trump told reporters in Washington before departing for southern California.  TRUMP THREATS Trump said the drug-related tariff would supplant provisions of a trade deal, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as USMCA, which has not been approved by Congress. In a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump repeated a threat to close the border if Mexico ""stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from..."" ""I am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border. Over 100,00 Americans die each year, sooo many families destroyed!"" the president tweeted. It was not immediately clear what other penalties he was considering. The White House did not respond to a request for elaboration. It also was unclear where Trump got the $500 billion figure. Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said the amount of drugs smuggled into the United States annually was probably in the range of $50-$60 billion. He emphasized that it was fueled by U.S. demand. ""He's blaming Mexico for our drug problem,"" Vigil said, adding that his words could hurt bilateral cooperation in battling drug-trafficking. ""The president should focus on reducing the demand and facilitating drug treatment centers here in the United States,"" he added. In recent days, Mexico has taken a more rigorous approach to interviewing and registering immigrants from Central America, Haiti and Cuba, according to officials. Previously, the Mexican government freely handed out humanitarian visas with the goal of allowing people to stay and work legally in Mexico. But it backed away from that policy after a surge in those requesting the documents and amid criticism from Washington. On Thursday, a Mexican federal police plane flew dozens of Haitians home. On Friday, the Migration Institute said on Twitter that 57 Cubans were sent back to Cuba by plane in the morning. More than 60 Cubans were flown home last week. Meanwhile, 20 states have filed a motion to block Trump's attempts to divert federal funds through an emergency declaration, New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said on Friday. The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday also filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's ability to seize the funds, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, also a Democrat, said. ",24.17999999999938,1

201," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Opposition to cannabis has come from an unexpected place in recent days - blue-state America. Thus far, the states which have legalized pot all lean left, or at least center-left. Hence, it may have come as a surprise when legalization efforts faced roadblocks in two key blue states: New Jersey and New York. In New Jersey, the governor wants to grant legal status to cannabis. However, lawmakers canceled the vote since it does not appear to have enough support in the State Senate. New York faces obstacles in the state capitol and several localities. Governor Andrew Cuomo has indicated that he will miss the deadline to include it in April's state budget. Moreover, many counties, some which encompass metro New York City, have expressed interest in opting out of legalization. This primarily affects stocks with weed-based operations in the state. Thankfully for Canopy Growth (NYSE:
CGC
) investors, its recent move into New York state involves the production of recently legalized hemp. However, these three smaller, U.S.-based marijuana stocks could face pain as these key states delay legalization:  Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:
IIPR
) stands out among other marijuana stocks by acting as a real estate investment trust (REIT). It earns revenue by owning greenhouses in industrial space and renting them out to growers. Also, due to its REIT status, it offers a dividend , something that most other marijuana stocks typically do not offer. Moreover, the company hiked the quarterly dividend to 45 cents per share last month, a yield of around 2.25%. However, with legalization efforts in New York tied off, IIPR stock could face setbacks. The company owns 13 properties total, two of them located in New York state. This comprises just over 15% of its total property. Interestingly, the San Diego-based firm owns more property in New York than in its home state of California. The company likely bought these properties in anticipation of legalization. Still, with both hemp and medical marijuana legal, it could pivot into those industries. Also, at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28.6, it trades at a lower multiple than other marijuana stocks. However, investors could still punish it in the near term for its relatively large stake in New York. Until New York's state government provides more clarity, investors should probably avoid IIPR.  The public may know Acreage Holdings (OTCMKTS:
ACRGF
) best for its group of backers. Its Board members include prominent politicians such as former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Former House Speaker John Boehner, who was once an opponent of marijuana, also sits on the board. It may need this political firepower as it contends with its presence in both New Jersey and New York. New Jersey is home to its 135,000 sq. ft. cultivation facility. It also partnered with a licensed alternative treatment facility in the state, presumably on the assumption that New Jersey would legalize. In New York, it runs four dispensaries and a 70,000 sq. foot cultivation facility. Trading at 195 times sales, the market prices it for perfection. Before this news came out, analysts had expected Acreage to turn a profit next year. They also predicted that revenues would rise by 115%. Now, with the status of weed in question in both states, investors may become wary. Also, it has only traded on the OTC markets since November. After briefly plummeting to $12 per share in December, it has settled at about $22 per share, not far above its IPO price. Acreage may benefit later from its substantial political influence. However, with its sizable presence in these states and its failure to move higher in its brief history, investors should stay away from ACRGF stock for now.  MedMen (OTCMKTS:
MMNFF
) describes itself as the ""standard bearer"" of the legal cannabis industry in the U.S. It owns facilities for cultivation, manufacturing and retail in five key states. Unfortunately, one of those states is New York, where it runs three dispensaries. MedMen also intends to buy PharmaCann , a private company that was awarded licenses to operate four dispensaries and a 128,000 sq. foot production facility in New York. MMNFF stands as an OTC stock trading at about $3 per share. However, it boasts a market cap of just under $1.5 billion and a price-to-sales ratio of 16.9. This multiple appears quite reasonable compared to other marijuana stocks. Analysts also forecast triple-digit revenue growth and possibly, a positive net income next year. However, a political setback in New York could delay that move to profitability. It also lessens the appeal of the PharmaCann merger, which both companies first announced in October. Given these doubts, investors should probably not buy until they see a clearer path in New York state. Delay or denial of legalization will profoundly affect all of these stocks. However, once these issues become old news, the stock could also benefit from the delay. The experience with marijuana stocks in Canada may serve as a lesson in this instance. Following legalization, a ""sell the news"" effect took place, and most cannabis equities plunged over the next two months. I have previously speculated that marijuana stocks would eventually become so-called ""sin"" stocks similar to Altria (NYSE:
MO
) and Constellation Brands (NYSE:
STZ
). Such equities tend to become dividend payers with low P/E ratios, drawing a much different type of investor. These legal setbacks could actually postpone such a fate, adding to the appeal of marijuana stocks, even the ones with a presence in New York and New Jersey. Hence, investors should not only seek to understand the short-term effects but also learn to look beyond them.

203," By Francesco Guarascio BUCHAREST, April 5 (Reuters) - The Italian government and the European Commission have reached a provisional agreement to reimburse some investors who bought shares in failed banks, an Italian official said, in an unprecedented move that would soften EU rules on bank rescues. The bail-in rules devised after the last decade's financial crisis were designed to make any given bank and its creditors - instead of taxpayers - financially responsible if it went bust, with shareholders first in line to pay up. Losses have also been inflicted on bondholders in some cases, while depositors have always been spared. But under the new provisional deal between Brussels and Rome, bondholders and shareholders of failed Italian banks could claim their money back, the official from the Italian finance ministry said. ""The Commission is in constructive contact with Italy on the proposed measures,"" the EU commissioner for financial services Valdis Dombrovskis said, declining to comment further. Under the agreement, shareholders with annual incomes below 35,000 euros($39,280) and assets worth less than 100,000 euros would be automatically compensated for their losses in past bank rescues, the official said. The deal would notably benefit Italian savers forced to buy bank shares in exchange for mortgages in what appears to have been fraudulent transactions, but its critics say it is unlikely that all those entitled to claim compensation under the wealth criterion were victims of swindling. In a March ruling that has been interpreted as a softening of the bail-in rules, EU judges overturned a decision the European Commission took in 2014 to block the rescue of Tercas, a small Italian bank, with money from the country's depositor fund. While Brussels could appeal that ruling, the deal with Italy would further weaken the legal framework. The agreement would need to be approved by the two parties in Italy's eurosceptic government, which is campaigning for EU elections in May. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement wants even softer terms to compensate those who were allegedly missold bank shares and bonds, an Italian official said. It and the co-ruling far-right League pressed for generous compensation for bank creditors before last year's national elections in Italy. ($1 = 0.8910 euros) ",24.17999999999938,1
204," WASHINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up their latest round of trade talks on Friday and were scheduled to resume discussions next week to try to secure a pact that would end a tit-for-tat tariff battle that has roiled global markets. The two sides offered few details of the progress as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He concluded three days of meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said a deal could be announced in the next four weeks. Washington and Beijing in 2018 slapped import duties on each other's products that have cost the world's two largest economies billions of dollars and disrupted manufacturing and supply chains. The United States is seeking reforms to Chinese practices that it says result in the theft of U.S. intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology from U.S. companies to Chinese firms. The negotiations included intellectual property, or IP, forced technology transfer, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, services, purchases and enforcement, the statement said. White house adviser Larry Kudlow, speaking on Bloomberg Television earlier in the day, said Liu was due back in Beijing after Friday's talks, but the two sides would press ahead to resolve remaining differences by video link. ""There's no let-up here, this is an ongoing process,"" Kudlow said. Washington also has demanded that Beijing curb industrial subsidies, open its economy wider to U.S. companies, and increase purchases of U.S. goods including farm and energy commodities to shrink the gaping trade deficit with China. ""We are making headway in a lot of areas. That includes enforcement, that includes IP theft, that includes forced technology transfers, ownership, cyberspace, commodities and all the rest of it,"" Kudlow said. ""Those are of course in the middle of the negotiations that are ongoing, but we've come further and farther than ever before."" While some reform pledges by Beijing are largely set, including an agreement to avoid currency manipulation, an enforcement mechanism to ensure that China keeps its pledges and the status of U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods must be resolved. The plan to continue the discussions was taken as a positive sign. ""The fact that they're still talking - and talking positively about the discussions - suggests they both think they're on the path to a resolution,"" said Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents U.S. firms doing business in China ",24.17999999999938,1
205," By Nevzat Devranoglu ISTANBUL, April 5 (Reuters) - Economists expect Turkey's central bank to delay cutting rates until around July, and to ease policy less aggressively than previously thought, a Reuters poll showed on Friday after two weeks of volatility in the country's financial markets. The poll's forecasts for the year-end policy rate ranged from 17.5 percent to 24 percent, with a median of 20.75 percent. The central bank has kept it at 24 percent since September when the Turkish economy was in the midst of a currency crisis the tipped it into recession. The central bank has said it will keep monetary policy tight until inflation shows a convincing improvement. Food prices jumped earlier this year, boosting annual consumer price inflation, despite unorthodox government efforts to bring them down. A sharp drop in the lira on March 22 set off a week of volatility ahead of local Turkish elections. It prompted the central bank to stop one-week repo auctions since March 25, effectively raising its funding rate by at least 1.5 percentage points, which was seen as a stop-gap tightening of policy. Ten out of 11 economists in the Reuters poll predicted that the central bank would leave its repo rate unchanged at a policy meeting at the end of April, while one economist expected it to raise its rate to 25.5 percent to match average weighed cost of funding. ""We expect inflation to come down substantially in the second half of 2019 due to the combination of base effects and economic slowdown,"" said Nora Neuteboom, economist at ABN Amro, adding that she expects the first rate cut by 1.25 percentage points, or 125 basis points, in July. ""We expect...a total easing of 500 (basis points) throughout the second half of 2019, albeit this is largely dependent on the market reaction to the first rate cut and the future inflation data,"" Neuteboom said. Asked about timing, three economists predicted the first rate cut would come in June while five pointed to July. One economist predicted September, another December, while one expected the central bank to leave rates unchanged throughout this year. A previous poll showed most of the rate cut expectations focused on a June monetary policy meeting. The central bank will announce its rate decision on April 25 at 2 p.m. (1100 GMT).

206," By Tracy Rucinski and Eric M. Johnson CHICAGO/SEATTLE, April 5 (Reuters) - Boeing Co plans to cut its monthly 737 aircraft production by nearly 20 percent as it works to manage the grounding of its MAX aircraft in the wake of two deadly crashes, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday. Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling aircraft were frozen after a global grounding of the narrowbody model following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10. Muilenburg said the company now knows that a chain of events caused a Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October and the Ethiopia disaster, with erroneous activation of so-called MCAS anti-stall software ""a common link"" between the two. Boeing said it continues to make progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent ""accidents like these from ever happening again,"" he said. Boeing had been planning to speed up production again in June to 57 a month. Shares in Boeing Co fell around one percent after the market closed on Friday. The 737 MAX is banned from flying in most countries across the world following the Ethiopia crash that killed all 157 people on board. Boeing faces logistical issues in finding places to park the growing number of grounded 737 MAX planes as well as being responsible for all their maintenance costs since it has been unable to deliver the jets to customers, two people briefed on the situation said. Manufacturers avoid halting and then resuming production as this disrupts supply chains and can cause industrial snags. One source said it would take up to 6 months to re-start production of such a complex supply chain once it had been stopped, but cautioned a complete halt was unlikely. Having to hold planes in storage without delivering them does, however, consume extra cash through increased inventory. Separately, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that U.S. investigators were given the raw data from Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 as soon as it was read in France last month. The NTSB has a transcript of the cockpit voice recorder as well and provided assistance in transcribing the recorder, Sumwalt said. He said the Ethiopian Airlines 302 preliminary report ""was very thorough and well done."" Former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart, who was named by the Federal Aviation Administration this week to head an international team to review the safety of the Boeing 737 MAX, told reporters Friday he thought the review, which will start Monday, could take about three months. It is still not clear what countries will take part. He said investigators are going to be focused far more on the interaction between software and pilots rather than mechanical issues in future. ""This is territory we are going to see more of,"" Hart said. ",24.17999999999938,1
207," By Tracy Rucinski and Eric M. Johnson CHICAGO/SEATTLE, April 5 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Friday it plans to cut its monthly 737 aircraft production by nearly 20 percent in the wake of two deadly crashes, signaling it does not expect aviation authorities to allow the plane back in the air anytime soon. Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling aircraft were frozen after a global grounding of the narrowbody model following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10, killing all 157 people onboard. U.S. and airline officials said they now believe the plane could be grounded for at least two months, but an even longer grounding is a serious possibility. The crash in Ethiopia and the crash of a Lion Air plane in Indonesia last October that killed all 189 people on board have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday said the company now knows that a chain of events caused both disasters, with erroneous activation of so-called MCAS anti-stall software ""a common link"" between the two. Boeing said it would not reduce jobs at the new production rate and will work to minimize the financial impact. The company's board will establish a committee to review how the company designs and develops airplanes, Muilenburg said. The group will ""recommend improvements to our policies and procedures"" for its 737 MAX and other airplane programs. Boeing said it continues to make progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent further accidents. Shares in Boeing Co fell around two percent after the market closed on Friday. While the number of 737 MAX planes grounded is just over 370, nearly 5,000 more are on order. Boeing faces logistical issues in finding places to park the growing number of planes as well as being responsible for all their maintenance costs since it has been unable to deliver the jets to customers, two people briefed on the situation said. Manufacturers avoid halting and then resuming production as this disrupts supply chains and can cause industrial snags. Boeing had been planning to speed up production in June to 57 a month. Having to hold planes in storage without delivering them does, however, consume extra cash through increased inventory. Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems Holdings said it will continue to make 52 737 MAX shipsets - the complete set of parts for each aircraft - per month, storing extras at its facilities. Its shares fell 3.5 percent. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that U.S. investigators were given the raw data from Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 as soon as it was read in France last month.

208," Shares of gaming industry and lottery supplier Scientific Games (NASDAQ: SGMS) jumped as much as 15.1% in trading Friday after documents were filed with the SEC that laid the groundwork for the IPO of a subsidiary. Shares gave back some gains as the day wore on but were still up 11.8% at 11:30 a.m. EDT. The social gaming subsidiary will be offered to the public under the company name SciPlay and trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""SCPL,"" assuming the IPO is completed. The business covers interactive lottery and gaming products, which could become core to the expansion of both businesses over mobile devices.  Image source: Getty Images. We didn't get much detail about what stake Scientific Games would be selling or what it would do with the money, but we know SciPlay earned $39.0 million in 2018 on $416.2 million of revenue. That's a sizable business and could be used to pay back $9.2 billion of debt on the balance sheet. A confidential draft registration was submitted in December, so investors have known this IPO was on its way. But filing an S-1 Form with the SEC is a big step toward making a public offering a reality. That's what investors are reacting to today, and they like what they're seeing so far. I wouldn't buy Scientific Games stock based on this potential IPO alone, but it's an event worth keeping a close eye on because it could help deleverage the company and improve profitability and flexibility for the business in the long term.  10 stocks we like better than Scientific Games

210," In this series, NerdWallet interviews new homeowners across the country about their unique homebuying journeys and the financial decisions that helped them along the way. Email vlai@nerdwallet.com to share your first-time homebuying story. Brittany Hilzinger, a 31-year-old restaurant server and part-time dog sitter who has been saving for a home since she was 17, recently purchased a $136,000 condo in Las Vegas. The San Diego native moved to Las Vegas with her husband Jesse earlier this year. But it wasn't all smooth sailing: A few months into the search, she was unexpectedly denied a loan and worked extra hours to pay for the condo with cash. Read her homebuying story and find out what she would have done differently. (This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity and length.) I moved in January. I'm originally from San Diego, but my husband and I vacationed often in Las Vegas. We looked at San Diego properties before we decided on Las Vegas, but the home prices in Las Vegas were so much more affordable. It's also relatively close to San Diego, so it's easy for me to go back to see my family. I also knew I could make about the same salary (or more) as a food server there. When I was 17, I realized that I wanted to buy a house someday and started saving back then. I was in high school and would save half of my paycheck from retail jobs. I loved the idea of owning something and making it mine. I've always been interested in the real estate market, and I also knew that the home prices in Las Vegas have been rising. My budget was $250,000. I wanted something not too close to the Strip, but still close to restaurants and shops. We were originally looking for a home with a yard since we have dogs, but couldn't get preapproved for one, so we decided on a condo. And after unexpectedly being denied a loan, I had enough money saved up to buy a condo. We figured that we could eventually rent it out for passive income. We started talking to a real estate agent in August 2018 and started looking seriously that October. We put in an offer on Nov. 30 for the condo, and it was accepted right away. Unfortunately, although I was preapproved for a loan, the loan company called me in December - about two weeks after our offer was accepted - and said they couldn't approve me for a loan because my 2016 taxes weren't showing enough income. I hadn't claimed all of my cash earnings from serving. I had great credit (over 800), but because I earn so much of my wages in cash and hadn't claimed all of it, my income wasn't sufficient enough. That was the worst week of my life. It was really stressful. We wondered if we should keep renting or just buy the condo with cash. I had more than the price of the condo ($136,000) in cash saved up, so we decided to buy it. We didn't have room to negotiate on the price; the owner was firm. We did a 45-day closing since we were moving from San Diego and I wanted to give myself time to buy new furniture and work like crazy since it was a cash purchase. We closed on Jan. 15, 2019.  Brittany Hilzinger started saving for a home at age 17. For us, it's a starter home and we don't plan to live here for more than three years. It's three bedrooms and two baths. I had my agent take pictures and give me his honest opinion. Although I didn't see the exact unit, I had a good sense of it since I had seen two other condos in the same complex. Ours was an amazing deal; it was between $2,000 and $3,000 less than others in the complex. Since it needed new floors, we got $2,000 reduced from the closing costs to help offset the cost. We're also in a better location in the complex and face east, so the [afternoon] sun isn't beaming on us. I'm a born saver. I look at the bigger picture and always have goals that I want to reach. The few things I splurge on are trips and my dogs, because I love to buy them toys and treats. When I turned 21, I got a job as a restaurant server. The restaurant closed down, so I started working in professional sports. I had a paid internship with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2010 and moved to Philadelphia in 2013 to work for them for six months. But serving offered me way more income than sports. After that, I moved back to San Diego and have been serving at gastropubs and craft beer restaurants ever since. In 2014, I started dog sitting for Rover, a marketplace for pet sitting and dog walking. I can make between $800 and $1,000 per month through the app, and I put all of it into my savings. At one point, I was working three server jobs and dog sitting at the same time. I would have claimed more of my cash tips from the previous tax year. In the moment, it was me thinking about having more money in my pocket, so I used to be afraid of doing that. I know now that claiming them will help me achieve what I want in the long term. [Editor's note: To comply with IRS requirements, report your tips to your employer monthly if they total $20.] I work with a lot of people around my age who are content renting, and some servers laughed at me or thought I was joking when I told them I was buying a house. But servers can make decent money. I hope to inspire more people to think about it. Jason Garcia, the real estate agent who helped Hilzinger find her home, discussed a few things first-time buyers in the area can keep in mind. Inventory in Las Vegas is growing. Good news for buyers: There are more homes coming on to the market. ""You have more choices,"" Garcia says. ""This means you don't have to feel as rushed buying and can take your time, compare different choices. You could even get help with closing costs ."" Consider living farther away from the Strip. Buyers tend to flock to the busy, casino-lined stretch south of downtown Las Vegas, which means they end up paying more for real estate. ""There are some great opportunities for people who may want to go to the northwest side, where you can get more bang for your buck,"" he says. ""Plus, traffic isn't bad in Vegas. You can get anywhere in the city within 30 to 45 minutes."" Your offer is more than the number. Garcia emphasizes that there are things you can bring to the table that aren't related to the dollar amount. ""It's not always about the highest price,"" he says. ""Sometimes the seller wants to move and doesn't want to be put into a temporary home, so you can offer a couple weeks of free lease back. Those factors are sometimes more important.""

211," A value stock is generally defined as that of a mature company with solid fundamentals, and that can be easily evaluated with metrics like the price-to-earnings ratio. A value investor's objective is to identify stocks that trade at a discount to their intrinsic value, with the goal of producing market-beating returns over time. Textbook examples of value stocks include Procter & Gamble , AT&T , and Walmart . Think well-established companies with relatively steady revenue. Broadly speaking, value stocks are typically less volatile than growth stocks and tend to hold up better when the economy sours. On the other hand, a growth stock is generally defined as that of a company with an above-average revenue or earnings growth rate. Growth investors aim to identify the best long-term growth opportunities relative to their current valuation. Popular growth stocks include companies like Amazon , Netflix , and Tesla . Having said all that, it's not always a clear-cut situation. Some companies can certainly fit into both categories. Just to name one example, it's rather easy to make the case that Microsoft  belongs in both categories. The company is large and established, with steady revenue and earnings, but also has an above-average growth rate. Here's a key point to know: You don't necessarily need to focus on one category or the other. There are varying degrees of growth and value, and several sub-categories within each one, such as small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks. The best strategy for a newer investor like yourself is to aim for a well-rounded portfolio with excellent companies of all kinds.  Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy now

213," April 5 (Reuters) - Shares of ride-hailing company Lyft Inc rose as much as 4 percent on Friday, setting the stock for its best day since its market debut last week, after short-seller Citron Research advised investors to hold on to the stock. The number of active Lyft riders has surged fivefold to 18.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, from the first quarter of 2016, and those numbers are set to rise further, Citron said, listing several other reasons to not be short on Lyft. As of Thursday, Lyft's short interest was $937 million, with 13.38 million shares shorted, which makes up about 41.2 percent of its float, according to data from S3 Partners, a financial technology and analytics firm. Describing ride-sharing as a ""megatrend"", and not just a fad, Citron said Lyft has good prospects, especially since millennials are foregoing car ownership for ride-sharing. ""This is not a trendy video game or a GoPro camera... this is a way of life that is saving people time and ensuring safety,"" the note said. ""The entire rideshare market in the U.S. only accounts for 1 percent of miles traveled today…. we have only just begun,"" Citron said. But brokerage Seaport Global, which started coverage on Lyft with a ""sell"" rating on Tuesday, said it was skeptical that consumers will give up car ownership in favour of relying on ride-hailing services. Daiwa Capital Markets also initiated coverage on the company on Thursday, with an 'outperform' rating and a price target of $80. The rating reflects strong revenue growth potential ahead for the company, the brokerage said, but added it expects losses to increase through 2020, and then reach break even by the end of 2022. Lyft's shares fell below their IPO price of $72 on their second day of trading, erasing all debut gains, after market research companies cited lack of a clear path to profitability. The company did not mention when it would turn profitable. It reported a loss of $911 million in 2018, wider than its $688 million loss in 2017, despite revenue doubling in 2018 to $2.16 billion. Daiwa added autonomous robotaxis, currently under development at tech and auto companies, are among the biggest threats to the company.  Lyft since IPO ",24.17999999999938,1
214," Not necessarily, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, high-growth stocks are best suited for investors with a long time horizon. Not only does this give you time to ride out the ups and downs of a relatively volatile portfolio, but it also gives you time to recover if one of your small-cap stocks doesn't pan out. So if you're 25, there's nothing inherently wrong with a retirement portfolio that's mostly composed of small- and mid-cap growth stocks. If you're 60, it's another story. In short, the closer you are to retirement, the greater your allocations should be to blue chip stocks and fixed-income investments. Second, when it comes to investing in small- and mid-cap growth stocks, diversification is extremely important. If you have your money spread across 15-20 solid, well-run growth stocks, you aren't too reliant on any one stock, but will still experience some nice gains if one of them turns out to be a home run. On the other hand, investing in just three or four of this type of stock can be great if you're right, but can be devastating to your financial future if you aren't. Relatively volatile growth stocks can certainly have a place in your retirement portfolio (I have a few in my own). However, it's important to maintain an age-appropriate asset allocation strategy and to not commit too much of your money to any one stock.  Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy now

Mac Greer: It's Thursday, April 4th. Welcome to Market Foolery ! I'm Mac Greer. Joining me in studio, we have Motley Fool analysts Emily Flippen and Andy Cross. Welcome! How are we doing this Thursday? Emily Flippen: Doing well! Andy Cross: Good! Hi, Mac! Greer: Good to see you! We have a show! We're going to talk some beer, wine, cannabis, and Warren Buffett. And those are two different stories. Cross: You had me sold right there. Greer: Buffett is not related to the beer, wine, and cannabis. I want to make that clear. Flippen: Yet. Greer: Yet. We will get to that. But we begin with Tesla. The ongoing drama, soap-opera story that is Tesla. Shares down big on Thursday after Tesla report ed that first-quarter deliveries fell short of expectations. This is just one of the story lines playing out, y'all. The other story line is, today, a judge will hear oral arguments as to whether Elon Musk should be held in contempt of court over a tweet that misstated the number of vehicles that Tesla expected to produce this year. All of that, you throw it together, Tesla shares down around 7% right now, Andy. What do you make of it? Cross: Let's break up the two pieces of news. When it comes to the orders, the quarter was much less than what analysts expected. It was down 30% on the delivery side from the fourth quarter, which was a record. They delivered more than 90,000. Now they're around 63,000. Down significantly. They pointed to this massive buildup of demand that they are seeing in Europe and China and not being able to deliver that. Elon Musk in the release did say that they still expect delivery of 360,000 to 400,000 total cars this year. There is a debate, Mac, and we'll talk a little bit about that debate, about what number they're really looking for. Elon Musk has been a little bit all over the place. But the quarter was not that great. Investors are reacting to that and wondering, ""Wow, if this is more of the future for what we will see from the challenges they have with the Model 3, is that going to impact long-term profitability for that car?"" And that really is going to be a big driver over the next five years of what Tesla's value will be to shareholders. They have to get that right. Clearly, right now, there's a lot of demand, but they're struggling to operationalize that into productive deliveries. Flippen: Yeah, and that's a hard problem to have. It doesn't matter if the demand's there if you're not able to fill that demand. In the past, we've seen people wait a very, very long time to have that demand filled by Tesla because there's so much value in owning a Tesla. It's surprised, I think, a lot of analysts to see that demand stay up regardless of their inability to quickly deliver vehicles. It'll be interesting to see in the future if it continues. I'm definitely carefully watching their Shanghai plans. We saw Tesla have a lot of problems getting a plant up and running here in the U.S. and getting that up to scale, so it was producing on a regular basis. Last year was full of issues in that process. So it'll be interesting to see if they're also capable of replicating that model in China, which is arguably a little bit of a harder place to get those cars produced. But if they're able to do that, they'll be able to more quickly meet that demand. Cross: They do have an advantage there. They have gotten friendly reception for building that plant, where they can go in and they can own the entire process there, as opposed to doing a joint venture. The market in China, as Emily referred to, it's gigantic. Last year, they did more than a million electronic vehicle sales compared to 360,000 here in the U.S. So, three times the size. It's the largest EV market in the world. It's already Tesla's second-largest market. We saw this quarter that they are trying to ship the cars over there. They don't have the Shanghai plant built yet. That's a struggle. Elon has talked about this, the challenge they've had with getting parts in the right spot and bringing parts from China to the U.S., shipping the cars back to China, and how inefficient that is. The China plant is one thing that I'm really watching with the investment there, Emily, like you mentioned. But this quarter, with a drop in the tax credit, and that's going to be phased out here in the U.S. This is more of a normal case with Tesla when it comes to the quarterly sales and deliveries than what they were expecting. Greer: Along those lines, Andy, I was asking the investing team what their biggest question was about Tesla. Ben's question was, what's the average selling price of Model 3s over the last quarter, and what are the gross margins of the lowest-price model? Two big questions there that we don't know the answers to. Cross: Yeah, we haven't gotten the results. They did say in the release today that the quarter's unexpected drop in Model 3 sales and total deliveries will impact net income for the quarter. I think Ben's question is really good because the Model 3, which is what Elon is trying to sell to the masses -- this is really their general mass-market car. Dropping the price from $60,000 to $44,000, maybe all the way down to $35,000. Obviously, as the price goes down, the gross margin potentially goes down. They really have to get the scale right to make that really profitable for Tesla shareholders. That's still an outstanding question. Greer: What about the second piece of this story, the court hearing over Elon Musk's tweet that misstated the number of vehicles that Tesla expected to produce this year? This whole debate about what is material, what is nonmaterial? Is this legal overhang? Is this an issue that Tesla investors should be worried about? Flippen: We saw yesterday some analysts pointing out that it was an interesting day to release the production information, the decline in deliveries. The reaction that we've seen today to the stock proves that that information is material. Investors obviously care about Tesla's ability to produce and sell their vehicles. So, incorrect tweets, this would seem to go for evidence that hey, yeah, that's material information. But honestly, with the legal system, things are never really quite known. It all comes down to some of the most minuscule wording of the tweets and the legalese. I'm excited to see what happens. I'm not sure that's a normal thing to say, but it'll be fun to watch. Cross: It seems like, with all of the social media tweets that Elon has had over the years, he's always had some threaded explanation of what he really meant. Whether it's a total number for the year of deliveries of 500,000 or more of a, ""Oh, no, that is the weekly rate that I meant."" He has explanations. I think this will be turned into a lot of ""He said this, what is the interpretation of that?"" And ultimately, I think while investors do care about the forecasts -- as Emily said, because they were expecting 75,000 this quarter, and Tesla did not deliver that -- I think ultimately, the proof is going to be in the pudding. What they actually deliver is going to drive the share price. Greer: Let's move on to Constellation Brands, the beer, wine, spirits, and cannabis company. Constellation is the mother ship for Corona and Modelo beers, those beers doing very well. The stock up today on earnings. On Wednesday, y'all, Constellation announcing that they had agreed to sell about 30 brands from their wine and spirits portfolio. The business, changing a bit. And this is a business, Emily, that last year bought a 38% stake in Canopy Growth , a Canadian marijuana company. We've got beer, wine, and spirits. We've got cannabis. How are things looking at Constellation? Flippen: Well, unfortunately, it feels like I'm not going to be getting my cannabis-infused wine anytime soon as a result of this. Cross: Aw, Emily! I'm sorry to hear that! Flippen: Investors are holding out for Constellation Brands to really deliver on its partnership with Canopy Growth to make that cannabis-infused beer or alcoholic beverages, which are expected to be loosened in Canada later this year with regulatory loosening in the fall. They're putting a pin in that investment until they're able to actually get off the ground with selling those products in Canada. If that's successful, then it opens up a lot of opportunity for other companies. We've seen Anheuser-Busch possibly getting into the same space. So, if they're successful, that really sets a playing field for what could revolutionize the alcohol industry. Cross: Why the investment that Constellation has made in Canopy, and I think it was $4 billion or something, it was significant, is when you look at the U.S. alcohol volume market, last year it was down 0.8%. The year before that, down 0.7%. Beer was even worse, it was down 1.5%, even though Constellation's having some successes in the beer market. Beer was down 1.5% last year. Volumes were down 1.1% in 2017. So, the trend for the alcohol market is really not in the favor. There are some bright signs out there in these things called soda-infused alcohol, alcopop, as they call it. That seems to be a market that the biggies are investing in. I know Diageo has invested in those. They've had some successes there. So, clearly, a lot of these big alcohol-branded companies are looking for other ventures and different ways to grow, because we're just not consuming as much beer and spirits and wine as we used to. Flippen: Constellation's a great example of that. They're getting into these ancillary spaces, but it's worth noting that Corona and Modelo are still really strong brands. While growth in those industries hasn't been particularly outstanding, Corona is going to surpass Coors as the second-largest beer brand family in the U.S. Corona is the No. 1 most-loved beer among Hispanic consumers. So there's obviously demand there. Modelo has seen double-digit growth over the last 26 of 27 quarters. That's huge! It has 40% of the total category growth in high-end beer. All of this is really going to say that beer as an industry isn't down and out. Cross: It's not. Actually, Boston Beer , the maker of Sam Adams, has actually seen some volume growth come back after a couple of years of some struggles. Really, the companies that are starting to suffer on this are the very large megabreweries. These companies start to struggle as, gosh, we're just not consuming as much beer as we used to in the U.S. or maybe globally. And the likes of a Boston Beer or Constellation Brands, Corona, to be able to finally start to take some market share back. Greer: We should add that Constellation is not getting out of the wine business. Instead, they're really focusing more on higher-end wines. Andy Cross, how would you define a higher-end wine? Cross: Maybe on a dollar amount? What is that... maybe higher than $20 a bottle? $25 a bottle, maybe? Greer: Emily? Flippen: I didn't realize that people bought wine that wasn't in boxes. Maybe I'm the wrong person to ask. Greer: So, your definition of a higher-end wine is ""not in a box."" Flippen: Two-buck chuck, right? That's in a bottle. Cross: [Boxed wine] actually comes in a bag, in a box. Flippen: A bag in a box, yeah. Greer: Is a bag below a box? What do we think? Cross: I don't think you can put it -- well, maybe you can, with the new boxes they sell. Flippen: Boxed water has really done well. Maybe boxed wine is ready for a comeback. Greer: I like that! Bringing back the boxed wine! Cross: Love it! Greer: Our final story here. There's no real hook for this story, we just thought it'd be a fun story to talk about. In his annual letter to shareholders back in February, Warren Buffett said that he was looking to make a quote ""elephant-sized acquisition."" This is a great time to basically speculate on what that acquisition may look like. We've got the Berkshire annual meeting coming up in May. So we've got to speculate. Again, I brought it to the investing team. As y'all think about what the next Buffett acquisition could look like, here are three answers I've got. Ready? Jason Moser says McCormick . That's his prediction. Flippen: [laughs] I'm shocked! Cross: That's his go-to for everything. Spice it up a little bit, Jason! Spice it up! Greer: I like that. Jim Gillies says Southwest Airlines . Tim Beyers says Salesforce . Cross: Wow! The Salesforce one would be amazing, if he decided to do that. Flippen: Bigger than an elephant, probably. Cross: Yeah, that's a $120 billion company. Greer: OK, so, Andy Cross. Buffett's next elephant-sized acquisition. Cross: Just for some context here, Mac. Berkshire, their last big acquisition was purchasing Precision Castparts for $35 billion back in 2015. So when he talks about going after these large acquisitions that are meaningful, I'm thinking like $35 billion to $50 billion in market cap. The one that I was thinking that would be a good fit with him is Sherwin-Williams . Sherwin-Williams is the paint company, a global company. They generate more than $17 billion in sales per year. They have very high returns on equity. Pretty consistent profit margins. The stock's done phenomenally well. It's a recommendation of ours in Stock Advisor . It's the kind of business that Buffett can clearly understand. They have a retail component. They have a wholesale component. I'm guessing maybe one of his houses probably has some Sherwin-Williams paint there. So, I'm saying Sherwin-Williams. Greer: OK. Emily, what do you think? Flippen: Well, I have two. I have one that I just want them to do. I don't think it's realistic. I don't think it's Buffett's style, but I so desperately want Buffett to revolutionize healthcare. Our country needs it. I would love it if Buffett were to acquire a company like Teladoc , and really just raise awareness of telemedicine. Hill: Did Jason pay you to say that? Flippen: You know, he's been rubbing off on me. He does sit next to me, so it's hard to avoid the Teladoc talk every day. I'm sold. Cross: At least he's in the space, though, with the Berkshire Hathaway, JP Morgan , Amazon initiative to try to change healthcare. So, at least he's thinking about it. Flippen: And that's what gives me some hope. It's clearly on the top of his mind. He's made comments in the past about investing for the purpose of changing industries, of doing good. That's a bit of a deviation from the way that he's invested in the past. So, fingers crossed. More realistically, I could see Buffett investing in a company like Ross or Burlington . It goes back to really understanding the business. These are businesses that serve the average American consumer. They've performed really, really well. Actually, a lot of these businesses, even though they're retail, they've done an amazing job of managing their inventory, of meeting consumer demand. I would be hard pressed to think that hasn't crossed Buffett's mind. Greer: Interesting ideas. My dream, probably not realistic, but my dream, of course, is Costco . He could pick it up for the low, low price of a little over $100 billion or so, market cap. Cross: Yeah. Greer: Is there any chance that could happen? Or it just doesn't fit, you think? Do I need to give up my Costco dream? Cross: No. Berkshire has more than $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet. They have $350 billion in shareholder equity. It's not cash, but it's shareholder equity. There are only 10 companies in the world that have a market cap of $350 billion. So there's a lot of capital for Warren Buffett to use with the insurance business and their cash. A $100 billion acquisition would be a pretty big one. Greer: But, $1.50 hot dog and drink. You've got to remember that. Cross: He has to love that! Greer: I guess you don't have to buy the entire company to get that, though. Flippen: He also looks like the kind of person who would shop at Costco, right? Greer: Absolutely! That's a compliment, right? Flippen: It's a compliment! Of course it's a compliment! Greer: OK, phew! You scared me there for a minute! Flippen: They don't let the riffraff like me in. Cross: He has said, ""I buy expensive suits. They just look cheap on me."" Greer: I don't even buy expensive suits. I think the last time I bought a suit...it was probably that my parents bought it for me. Cross: Probably at Costco. Greer: Yeah, in the 70s. OK, so, the desert island question as we wrap up. Again, don't invest this way at home. It's just a fun question. If you're on a desert island, you basically have nothing to do because you're on a desert island. You're there for five years, and you've got to buy one of these stocks. What are you going with? You've got to own it for the next five years. Let's go Tesla, Constellation Brands, or Berkshire Hathaway. Andy Cross? Cross: Oh, gosh, I would say, for the next five years, I'm going with Tesla. Greer: Wow! Surprising! Cross: Full disclosure, Berkshire Hathaway is one of my largest personal holdings. But, I think five years, I'm going to -- Greer: Roll the dice! Cross: -- sit back with Elon and roll the dice. Flippen: I'm going to take a little bit of a riskier choice here, stick with the opportunity for growth. I see the most growth opportunity with Constellation Brands. If the investment in Canopy Growth does well, and they revolutionize the space, that could mean amazing things for their business. If it doesn't, and it really just falls flat, at least you still own shares of a really solid company. Pays a steady dividend. Can't be upset about that. Greer: You've got the beer, you've got the high-end wines. Cross: On your desert island, you're going to have a lot of fun! Flippen: Oh, yeah! [laughs] Greer: I like it!

220," By Richard Lough and John Irish DINARD, France, April 5 (Reuters) - Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations implicitly warned eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar on Friday against an advance towards the capital Tripoli as they scrambled to defuse a dangerous escalation in the north African oil producer's power struggle. A military advance towards Tripoli and Libya's U.N.-backed government by Haftar has taken the United Nations and Western powers by surprise, just as its secretary general was in the capital to plan a peace conference this month. ""We firmly believe that there is no military solution to the Libyan conflict,"" the ministers said in a statement sent amid talks in western France. ""We strongly oppose any military action in Libya. Any Libyan actor or faction that precipitates further civil conflict are harming innocent people and standing in the way of the peace that Libyans deserve,"" the statement said, without naming Haftar directly. The ministers said they backed U.N. efforts just hours after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres departed Libya following a meeting with Haftar to try to avert civil war. Concern over Libya's stability is heightened by continuing political tensions around Europe over migration from north Africa, despite the fact that the numbers of new arrivals in Europe via the central Mediterranean have plummeted. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had earlier welcomed his counterparts from the club of big, rich nations under a dull grey sky in Brittany, for a meeting already overshadowed by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's absence and Britain's Brexit meltdown. French diplomats say Paris has scaled back its ambitions for France's presidency of the club of major industrialized countries after U.S. President Donald Trump threw last year's summit in Canada into disarray, backing out of a joint communique and firing barbs at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A French diplomat sought to downplay Pompeo's snub saying: ""We're working well with the Americans. Yes, we have differences on some subjects, but that isn't holding back the quality of our dialogue."" The ministers had aimed to agree on Friday on a code of conduct to tackle cyber interference in their democracies, but had turned their focus to Libya instead, diplomats said.  BREXIT LOOMS LARGE Workers at dawn had furiously scrubbed away at graffiti spray-painted onto buildings near the secure zone in Dinard that attacked capitalism and President Emmanuel Macron. The slogans screamed ""Thieving banks"", ""Revolution"" and ""No to the G7"", mirroring the anger vented across France in five months of anti-government ""yellow vest"" protests fuelled by perceptions of a growing rich-poor divide and aloof politicians. The summit is expected to result in three joint statements on cyber security, sexual violence against women in armed conflict and trafficking in the Sahel region, and not too much wrangling over issues where there is less consensus such as Iran and Russia. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would use the summit to call on his European counterparts to support his government's request for a short delay to Britain's exit from the European Union. British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to Brussels on Friday asking for a delay of Brexit until up to June 30, while saying she aims to get Britain out of the EU earlier to avoid it participating in European elections. ""What we are looking for is to avoid a long extension,"" Hunt said. ""We are a democracy with a hung parliament, so it's not easy."" Hunt said the G7 was proof Britain would not play a diminished international role after Brexit. ",24.17999999999938,1

British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to Brussels on Friday asking for a delay of Brexit until up to June 30, while saying she aims to get Britain out of the EU earlier to avoid it participating in European elections. ""What we are looking for is to avoid a long extension,"" Hunt said. ""We are a democracy with a hung parliament, so it's not easy."" Hunt said the G7 was proof Britain would not play a diminished international role after Brexit. ",24.17999999999938,1
222," By Laila Kearney and Scott DiSavino NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - After Texas pushed the United States over the last decade to become the world's biggest oil producer last year, the heart of the shale revolution is starting to show fatigue. The volume of crude being pumped out of Texas recently saw its first monthly dip in a year. Oil well productivity in Texas's Permian basin - the country's largest oil field - is falling, and the number of drilling rigs operating in the United States has declined for six straight weeks. ""For certain companies, production could start to flatline, even roll over"" in the second half of the year, said James West, a senior managing director for research analysts Evercore ISI. ""I think you will see revisions to the overall growth forecasts ... for U.S. production."" Evercore originally expected the land rig count to rise 6 percent in 2019; last week it revised its forecast to a 1 percent drop for the year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in March trimmed its crude production forecast to an average of 12.3 million barrels per day (bpd) for 2019 from 12.4 million bpd. That was the first time the EIA cut its production estimate since September. Morgan Stanley on Thursday shaved 100,000 bpd off its U.S. crude growth projection for the year due to well ""productivity improvements slowing, the rig count rolling over"" and guidance from exploration and production companies, it said. U.S. crude supply ballooned in 2018, which overall production rising by 1.7 million bpd to a record 10.9 million bpd in 2018. That was the biggest year-over-year increase in output, according to EIA data going back to 1859. The number of drilling rigs started to fall after domestic crude prices dropped to $42 a barrel in December from a peak of $76 in October. Prices have since recovered, with U.S. crude now at $62, but the rig count is now near its lowest level in almost a year, according to General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm. ""Usually there is about a six-month lag between a drop in rigs and an impact to production levels,"" said Jodi Quinnell, an analyst at Genscape. That means the full effect of the drop in rigs might not be seen for several months. Unless prices skyrocket, independent shale companies are expected to maintain lower levels of spending. U.S. drillers, heeding the wishes of investors, have been cutting spending in response to years of lackluster returns. While majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are expanding in Texas's Permian region, independent companies are not. While the major oil companies plan to spend about 16 percent more on U.S. drilling and completions in 2019 versus last year, independent exploration and production (E&P) companies are expected to cut spending by around 11 percent, according to financial services firm Cowen & Co. Lower amounts of oil are also being delivered per well, slowing the rate of output growth. In the Permian Basin, per-well productivity is projected to fall by about 6 percent in April 2019 compared with a year ago, according to federal data.

224," By Huw Jones LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Cboe has decided to offer trading in all shares in London and Amsterdam following a row between regulators over where shares can be traded if Britain leaves the EU on April 12 without securing a delay or a transition deal with Brussels. Europe's biggest cross-border share trading platform said if there is no deal, trading in British and Swiss securities will continue on its British platform, but trading in European Economic Area instruments - mainly euro denominated stocks - will cease and shift to Amsterdam. Cboe said that if there is a long delay to Brexit or that a deal is negotiated, it would not start up in Amsterdam until it is able to offer trading in all securities on both its British and Dutch venues, which is likely to be later in 2019. This marks a shift at Cboe, which accounts for nearly a fifth of pan-European share trading. Mark Hemsley, president of Cboe Europe, said in January the exchange would only trade EEA stocks in Amsterdam, with British and Swiss shares limited to London. This would avoid splitting liquidity in euro, Swiss or UK shares between two centres which could damage prices, he said. The bloc's markets watchdog ESMA surprised exchanges last month by saying that if there is a no-deal Brexit, more than 6,200 shares, including 14 British stocks, could only be traded on a platform inside the bloc. Britain'sFinancial Conduct Authority was angered by what one exchange official described as a ""land grab"" by an EU keen to build up its capital market. Exchange officials are now waiting to see if the FCA will hit back and rule that under a no-deal Brexit, UK and some European shares could only be traded in Britain. Cboe's revised Brexit strategy means that its customers across Europe have a venue to trade all shares. The London Stock Exchange's pan-European trading platform Turquoise has set up a hub in Amsterdam, while rival Aquis Exchange chose Paris. ""Up until now, we all believed we would be trading euro shares in Europe and UK and Swiss shares in the UK,"" Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange said. ""Ever since the ESMA share trading obligation (STO) and a potential STO from the FCA, which people think is highly likely to happen, then you are going to have to split liquidity,"" Haynes said. ""This is extremely bad news for end investor, but politically, people want to fight for territory here."" ",24.17999999999938,1

226," The stock market moved higher on Friday morning, buoyed by enthusiasm about the prospects for the U.S. economy to weather a slowdown following the release of solid employment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of 11:30 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was up 37 points to 26,422. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gained 11 points to 2,890, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) picked up 39 points to 7,931. March brought 196,000 new nonfarm jobs in the U.S., and unemployment rates stayed steady at 3.8%. That helped lift shares of many companies, but Boeing (NYSE: BA) wasn't one of them, as the aerospace giant took steps to work through the difficulties surrounding its 737 MAX aircraft line and the two crashes that have created considerable controversy about the model's design. Meanwhile, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB) looked beyond North America for growth and got a key win in its efforts to have a substantial presence in the European market.  Image source: Boeing. Shares of Boeing were modestly lower on the latest news from the beleaguered aircraft manufacturer. In a release Thursday afternoon, CEO Dennis Muilenburg apologized on behalf of Boeing for the lives lost in the two recent 737 MAX crashes . Although he emphasized that final reports haven't yet been detailed, Muilenburg did admit that the aircraft's maneuvering characteristics augmentation system got erroneous aerodynamic information that resulted in its improper activation. ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk,"" Muilenburg said. ""We own it and we know how to do it."" The CEO said that after tireless work, Boeing is almost ready to finalize its software update to implement across the 737 MAX fleet, and although he apologized to Boeing's airline customers for the impact of the aircraft's grounding, Muilenburg nevertheless stressed the company's relentless focus on safety. The statement is an important step forward from Boeing, but it certainly won't put an end to the impact of the crashes. Already, lawsuits from those killed in the incidents have started to appear, and allegations of design defects could increase the likelihood that Boeing will have to address more of those lawsuits in U.S. courts, where verdicts are likely to be higher. Moreover, affected carriers like Southwest Airlines and American Airlines Group will have credible cases to recover damages due to the grounding of the aircraft. Shareholders in Boeing therefore face a long wait before they'll be able to measure the long-term hit to the company's reputation and its financial condition . Shares of Aurora Cannabis were up about 2% after the Canadian marijuana company said that it had scored a major win in its international business efforts. Aurora announced that the German regulatory agency responsible for regulating drugs and medical devices named the cannabis company as one of three winners in a public tender to cultivate and distribute marijuana for medical purposes within the European nation. Aurora emerged victorious from a group of 79 participating companies, and it ended up taking five out of the 13 available lots, the most allowed under the rules of the process. The provisions of the final contracts should include minimum supply of 4,000 kilos over a four-year period. The cannabis that Aurora produces will be sold directly to the German government, which will then participate in supplying wholesalers with products to distribute to pharmacies across Germany. As part of the deal, Aurora will build an indoor cultivation facility near Leipzig, complying with all regulations surrounding cannabis facilities. For Aurora, expanding internationally is an important part of its long-term strategy, and the German facility should help it build out a global production footprint. If things go well in Germany, then Aurora could use the win as a springboard for further expansion across Europe and beyond.  10 stocks we like better than Boeing

231," By Kenneth Li and Ju-min Park NEW YORK/SEOUL, April 5 (Reuters) - When it comes to who triumphed in the multi-billion dollar global race to launch the world's first 5G next generation wireless network, the winner is clear ... depending on who you ask. Early Wednesday in South Korea, Reuters published a story quoting South Korean officials declaring victory over the United States and China as the site of the world's first commercial launch of a fifth generation telecoms network. After the piece was published, AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc intensified their angry rejections of South Korea's boast in post-publication communications sent to Reuters on Wednesday. AT&T said it was the victor because it announced on Dec. 18 that it planned to launch its 5G network in 12 U.S. cities that month. However, its network is available only to consumers using a mobile hotspot device, not on 5G phones. Verizon, for its part, countered that it had come first. Hours after the Reuters report, it said it had already launched its 5G network and that it would be available on a new Motorola phone - though only in Chicago and Minneapolis. ""We stand by our story,"" a Reuters spokeswoman said. The intensity with which company representatives disputed each other's claims underscores the high stakes in the battle for supremacy over an industry that is expected to spend $275 billion over seven years in the United States alone, according to Accenture estimates. The winner is seen playing a central role in helping to generate some $12.3 trillion in annual revenue across a broad range of industries by 2035, according to IHS Markit. The technology, which can provide data speeds at least 20 times faster than 4G, will also underpin the great advances of the next era, from self-driving cars and augmented reality to smart cities and artificial intelligence. ""Being first is important in our industry and we want that recognition,"" an AT&T spokesman said, adding that the company spent $130 billion over the last five years to upgrade its network. Some experts point out that the jockeying will mean little to consumers. ""The reason you're getting that reaction is this is a battle of marketing vaporware rather than real network evolution,"" said Craig Moffett, telecoms and communications analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""They're tripping over themselves to claim they have a 5G network,"" he said. ""But we're years away from it having any impact on user experiences."" Bragging rights aside, being first is a matter of national pride. So excited was U.S. President Donald Trump about dominating the telecoms future, he invented a technology that does not yet exist - 6G - in a Feb. 21 tweet. ""I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard. American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind,"" he tweeted. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  RACE TO LAUNCH South Korea's carriers had announced plans to launch their 5G networks by Friday. But by 5 p.m. local time Wednesday word began to spread that Verizon was planning a surprise debut of its own 5G network as early as Thursday, a full week ahead of its original intended schedule, an official at South Korea'sMinistry of Science and ICT told Reuters. To snatch victory from the jaws of Verizon, the South Korean carriers raced against the clock and agreed to collectively light up the country's 5G networks just six hours after finding out about Verizon's plans, said the official, who declined to be named. South Korean carriers including SK Telecom and KT Corp flipped the switch at 11pm local time (1400 GMT/1000 EST), nearly an hour ahead of when Verizon confirmed it had launched in the two markets in the United States at 10:55am EST (1455 GMT). ""It is a pretty big deal for every mobile carrier who can be called the world's first,"" the Ministry of Science official said. On why Verizon accelerated its launch plan by a week, a Verizon spokesman said its network was ready. ""Our customers were enthusiastic and ready to use 5G,"" the spokesman added.

232," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Carvana  (NYSE:
CVNA
) is on a mission to change the way people buy cars. They're harnessing the power of digitization and applying it to the massively fragmented auto industry. As such, I think an entry in Carvana stock at current valuations is attractive. Already, the numbers show that Carvana is well on its way to riding the long-term secular trend in online purchasing.  Online purchases are certainly more conducive for commodity-like items. Books, toys, certain electronic hardware are all relatively uniform and don't require consumers to give things a test run. Cars, on the other hand, may seem less ripe for online disruption. However, the digital economy is changing attitudes quickly. Data shows that almost all research on cars is already conducted online, that 75% of consumers would consider purchasing a car online and that 52% of car buyers test drive only one vehicle. So the barriers to Carvana's business model are lower than one might initially think. Carvana is executing on its mission. Retail units sold and gross profit per unit are the primary metrics I would look at to measure their growth and success. For the former, units sold have increased 113% year-over-year from 44,252 to 94,108 . Compare this to just 2,105 units sold in 2014 and you'll see there's a trend tracking up and to the right. What's even more impressive is that quarter-over-quarter retail units sold has been increasing.  There are no down quarters that get evened out when figures are annualized. Carvana has been selling more units since the first quarter of 2014, indicating that they have tapped into an industry with rapid secular growth. Carvana is selling lots of cars, but are they doing it with good margins? The answer to that is yes - and increasingly so. CVNA has been tinkering internally with their pricing algorithms, and it's working. Gross profit per unit is also tracking similarly - from $1,539 in 2017 to over $2000 last year. This means that each incremental car sale is adding more to the profitability of the Company than cars sold in prior years. It's no surprise then, that looking further down the P&L, overall EBITDA margin is tracking upward, and Carvana could see that hit positive territory in the next year or two. Carvana has over 14,000 cars to select from and provides users with over $1,000 in savings per vehicle compared to traditional car dealers. Only 8% of consumers rate traditional car salesman highly trustworthy and 81% of consumers do not enjoy the car buying process.  Carvana improves the user experience dramatically. Piles of paperwork that no one actually goes over with a fine-tooth comb are now streamlined into a ten-minute process from beginning to end. Next-day car deliveries are available in select markets for buyers who are antsy to drive their new vehicle. A survey performed by Bazaarvoice as of December 2018 showed that 96% of users would recommend it to a friend. CVNA's Car vending machine is a sight to behold . It combines operational efficiencies (especially on the real estate side) with creative branding. Currently there are 15 vending machines operating nationwide. In the Nashville market, Carvana saw market penetration double in two quarters after a vending machine launch. Betting on innovation is always a good decision. Carvana is still in the early stages of a long-term secular trend. The user experience and business model have been validated over the last four years with revenues, margins, and unit sales up consistently. It's an experience that appeals to younger buyers and has yet to show the full potential when at scale. As the company continues to increase penetration and add new markets, Carvana stock will track the same way as its metrics - up and to the right. As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

A Triumph-made wing assembly. Image source: Triumph Group. The aerospace structures unit, which manufactures aircraft composite and metallic wing assemblies and fuselages for a range of customers, has been a consistent drag. Triumph said selling the unit would allow it to reduce debt and focus on a core portfolio of interiors, systems, and aftermarket supplies. ""Aerospace structures has made significant operational improvements over the last several years while updating its mix of programs and sites to reduce risk to both customers and Triumph shareholders,"" Crowley said in a statement. ""These actions expand the option set for aerospace structures' future as their dedicated employees and suppliers continue to deliver on customer commitments and field new technologies and automation to enhance their competitiveness."" A sale of the aerospace structures business would be a major step in reducing the risk in Triumph's portfolio, and the remaining businesses are solidly profitable. But the company will still need to demonstrate it can generate consistent growth and free cash flow from the revised portfolio. Even after the Friday jump, Triumph shares are inexpensive, trading at 0.4 times sales, compared with industry leader TransDigm 's 6.5-times sales multiple. But it is late in the cycle to be chasing a turnaround story. Be careful chasing Triumph as it climbs.  10 stocks we like better than Triumph Group

236," Once a person successfully reaches retirement, his or her financial priorities naturally undergo a shift. Where before you were in ""build up my portfolio"" mode, now you're in ""spend down my portfolio"" mode.

The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.  This video was recorded on March 26, 2019. Alison Southwick: Next question comes from William. ""I'm almost 69, and between my wife and me we receive $21,000 from a pension and $28,000 from Social Security each year. Our IRA is valued at $130,000 and we have other investments also worth $130,000. ""As we draw down the IRA account we will move the net amount, after taxes, to a taxable account. The long-term gains and qualified dividends from this account won't be taxed, though it may increase the amount of Social Security that is taxable. Should we draw out large amounts from the IRA but keep our income below $100,000 to stay in the 12% tax bracket or pull out minimum amounts and leave the taxes to the ones who later inherit this account? They are in a higher tax bracket at this time."" Robert Brokamp: Well, William, a couple of things. The general rule for when to withdraw money from your accounts in retirement if you have different accounts of different types is to withdraw money from the taxable account first and leave your retirement accounts alone. Unfortunately, at some point you do have to take money out of your traditional accounts at 70 and a half, and it sounds like that's what William is thinking about because he's getting close to that age. It also sounds like he doesn't need the money, because he plans to just take that money out and then put it in a taxable account. He's saying that the dividends and capital gains will be free of taxes. That's because below a certain threshold and a certain tax bracket, you actually pay no taxes on dividends and capital gains as long as they're qualified dividends and long-term capital gains. So it sounds to me like what he's thinking is maybe he should take advantage of that as much as possible to get money out of the IRAs and set that new cost basis, because it's eventually going to be left to his kids, so it's essentially saving his kids some taxes. If he leaves it in the IRA, when you inherit an IRA and take the money out, it's all taxable. Megan, I don't know if you agree, but it sounds like what he's trying to do is to lower the tax burden of the people who are eventually going to inherit this money. Megan Brinsfield: Yes, it sounds like that's what he's trying to do, and it's especially nice of him, I thought, when I first saw this question. I was like, ""You're already leaving them money. You want to make it tax efficient for them, too?"" Southwick: They'll never appreciate it. Brinsfield: Yeah. Southwick: They don't know what you went through. Brinsfield: Exactly. The troubles you've seen. Southwick: The taxes you've avoided. Brinsfield: Yes, all for them. One thing to consider, here, is that they seem to be in a place where they can afford to take on a little bit more tax burden each year. Just referencing my handy-dandy tax bracket sheet -- the other bracket in March... Brokamp: Which we all have, by the way. Southwick: Pull it out. Brokamp: That's right! The other March bracket. Brinsfield: As a married couple filing jointly, you can have $77,400 of income before you're taxed at the 22% rate. Everything under that is 12%. So if you consider the fact that you have to subtract a $24,000 standard deduction to get there in the first place, you could have a gross income of almost $100,000 and pay 12% on that, and that's going to be extremely attractive compared to almost any recipient's tax rate. So I think that's really wise of them to do, basically year to year. Because they're getting to that 70 range, they're going to have a minimum that they have to withdraw, but they could withdraw extra up to that roughly $100,000 threshold in order to increase the tax efficiency even further. Brokamp: I would say to answer his question on whether I would do that or not, clearly they're able to live off the Social Security and the pension. But when you look at their actual savings -- a total of $260,000 -- for a retiree that's not actually a whole lot, and it may not be enough of a cushion if later on they have higher health expenses or long-term care. I would say just make sure that you're taking care of yourself. I like the fact that you're trying to be more generous to your heirs, but just looking at the number of assets that you have, I would still do everything you can to maximize your situation first. Brinsfield: I think that's fair, because the other thing is they're not going to die at the same time, so there might be some loss of either Social Security and/or pension that then requires a higher reliance on those savings. Brokamp: With every retirement plan with a married couple you always have to analyze what's going to happen if one's spouse dies -- what's going to happen if another spouse dies -- and see how that affects both income as well as expenses. Southwick: The bottom line, William, is that's really sweet of you, but we're giving you permission to look out for yourself first. Brokamp: Yes, that's it. Southwick: Be selfish.

237,"In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice.

238," By Ernest Scheyder April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. government officials plan to meet with executives from automakers and lithium miners in early May as part of a first-of-its-kind effort to launch a national electric vehicle supply chain strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter. While Volkswagen AG, Tesla Inc and other electric-focused automakers and battery manufacturers are expanding in the United States and investing billions in the new technology, they are reliant on mineral imports without a major push to develop more domestic mines and processing facilities. For a graphic, click U.S. imports of lithium have nearly doubled since 2014 due in part to rising demand from Tesla, SK Innovation Co and others building battery plants in the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. ""We need to find ways to more efficiently develop our nation's domestic critical mineral supply because these resources are vital to both our national security and our economy,"" North Dakota Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement to Reuters when asked about the meeting. Hoeven and Senator Lisa Murkowski, chair of the Senate's energy committee, have been invited to attend the meeting. Officials from the U.S. Department of State, Department of Energy, Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey plan to attend, according to two of the sources. As part of the effort, Murkowski is expected to introduce standalone legislation aimed at streamlining the permitting process for lithium and other mines, bolstering state and federal studies of domestic supplies of critical minerals and encouraging mineral recycling, among other topics, according to a source familiar with the matter. Some of those efforts were part of broader energy legislation in prior Congresses that failed, and Murkowski hopes that similar legislation will draw broader attention to the topic, according to the source. Five companies, including Lithium Americas Corp , are developing U.S. lithium projects that plan to use new technologies to extract the metal from clays, bromine and even oilfield waste, processes not common elsewhere and considered game-changing by some analysts. But not all of them have secured financing. For a graphic, click If all five come online by 2022 as planned, the country would produce at least 77,900 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent each year, making the country one of the world's largest lithium producers. Lithium development projects have historically faced numerous obstacles, so that production number is far from guaranteed. ""Creating a domestic electric vehicle supply chain is the perfect blueprint to make America great again,"" said Jesse Edmondson, chief executive officer of U.S. Critical Minerals, a start-up firm buying lithium mineral rights in the U.S. Southeast. Representatives from Tesla, Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co plan to attend the Washington meeting and discuss with federal officials potential policy changes that could encourage development of a domestic supply chain to mine, process and supply lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite for battery manufacturers and automakers, according to the sources. Tesla and GM did not respond to requests for comment. A Ford spokesperson said that the company regularly engages with stakeholders on various supply chain topics. Albemarle Corp and Livent Corp, two U.S.-based companies that mine lithium in South America, also plan to attend, as do executives from the handful of lithium mines under development in the United States, according to the sources. ""We are looking forward to participating in a forum with policy makers and industry participants who are focused on ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the development of the electric vehicle industry,"" said Paul Graves, CEO of Livent, which has said it is eyeing expansion opportunities. Albemarle, which operates the only existing lithium mine in the United States, declined to comment. The one-day meeting will be divided into morning workshops focused on financing and permitting obstacles, with one-on-one afternoon meetings between regulators and industry executives, according to the sources. ""We're trying to make sure policymakers have an understanding of this complex situation,"" said James Calaway, chairman of ioneer Ltd, which is developing a lithium project in Nevada that also hold a large concentration of boron, used in a plethora of consumer goods. In Arkansas, Standard Lithium Ltd is developing a pilot project to extract lithium from the bromine waste of a Lanxess AG chemical facility. ""We have an opportunity to take a huge step forward in lithium production, and we want to support that,"" Asa Hutchinson, the governor of Arkansas, told Reuters. Hutchinson and some other U.S. officials want U.S. lithium projects to stand alone without financial support from the government, a potential impediment as financiers often look for even tacit government support before investing in new, unproven technologies. ""There's a real opportunity in the electric vehicle supply chain if the United States wakes up,"" said Jonathan Evans, president of Lithium Americas, which is developing a lithium project in Nevada expected to open by 2022.

239," By Tom Miles GENEVA, April 5 (Reuters) - Russia won a dispute about ""national security"" at the World Trade Organization on Friday, in a ruling over a Ukrainian transit dispute that may also affect global automobile tariffs that could be imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The WTO panel ruling, the first ever on the right to a national security exemption from the global trade rules, awarded Russia a legal victory because it had successfully invoked national security. ""An emergency in international relations would, therefore, appear to refer generally to a situation of armed conflict, or of latent armed conflict, or of heightened tension or crisis, or of general instability engulfing or surrounding a state,"" it said. Opponents of Trump's tariffs have ridiculed the White House's assertion that ""economic security is national security"" and have retaliated against U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs imposed in March last year, saying they are mere protectionism, with no link to national security. Trump is considering using the same legal basis for a 25 percent tariff on global imports of cars, which the WTO has said would be a bigger economic shock than the U.S.-China trade war. Invoking national security was taboo at the WTO for decades after it was founded in 1995. Diplomats referred to it as ""Pandora's box"" which could never be closed once it was opened, and would undermine the discipline of the WTO's widely accepted rules. But in the past three years, Russia has cited it in the dispute with Ukraine, Trump has invoked it, and Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have cited it in a dispute with Qatar. Ukraine went to the WTO in 2016, complaining of a huge reduction in trade with Asia and the Caucasus region after Russian President Vladimir Putin banned road and rail transport from Ukraine unless the route also went through Belarus. Russia'sEconomy Ministry said that Friday's ruling had recognised Ukraine's arguments to be unfounded, and said the issue was of systemic importance for the WTO. Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said the ruling added weight to Russia's arguments against Trump's metals tariffs. The ruling can be challenged on appeal by Russia or Ukraine. The panel comprised Georges Abi-Saab, an Egyptian former head of the WTO's Appellate Body, Ichiro Araki, a Japanese expert on WTO law, and Mohammed Saeed, a Pakistani expert on customs and trade.

240," By Susan Mathew April 5 (Reuters) - Most Latin American currencies firmed against a slightly stronger dollar on Friday, while Brazil's real weakened as President Jair Bolsonaro appealed to leaders of five big centrist parties to back his pension reform plan. The real slipped 0.1 percent, having lost as much as 0.36 percent earlier in the session, but was on course for its best week since early February. The outlook for the real has weakened for the first time since Bolsonaro took office at the start of the year amid doubts about the pension reform drive, a Reuters poll on Friday showed. ""The recent political turmoil suggests that the government's political coordination needs to improve in order to maximize the total fiscal savings coming from the pension reform. We continue to expect that the government will win approval of a decent reform,"" analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note. Meanwhile, Mexico's peso ticked 0.3 percent higher and was on track to log its biggest weekly gain in more than six months. White House adviser Larry Kudlow said U.S. President Donald Trump sees improvement from Mexico regarding border issues and will not close the southern border at the moment. The peso has been volatile over the past few sessions. Currencies in Chile, Colombia and Peru firmed between 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent as the dollar rally lost steam.

241," Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) already offers its Prime members discounts, free shipping options, streaming media, and a growing list of other perks. One of those new benefits is a free 12-month subscription to Nintendo (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) Switch Online. Nintendo Switch Online lets Switch gamers play games online and access a library of classic NES games. The individual plan costs $3.99 per month, $7.99 for three months, or $19.99 per year. Existing Nintendo Switch Online members can also sign up for Prime to add an extra year to their existing plans.  Image source: Nintendo. Amazon will initially provide a three-month Nintendo subscription, which can be converted into a full-year membership if the Prime account is still active after 60 days. Let's see how this new offer could be an advantage for Amazon and Nintendo. Amazon is promoting the Nintendo Switch offer through Twitch Prime, the gaming and esports service that is bundled with Amazon Prime. Amazon acquired Twitch in 2014, and the esports portal now serves over 2.2 million content creators and more than 15 million unique daily visitors who spend an average of 95 minutes watching live games. Amazon doesn't disclose how much revenue it generates from Twitch, but it could eventually serve as a launchpad for its own game publishing arm, Amazon Game Studios . Twitch also enhances Amazon's streaming media ecosystem, which also includes Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Music. Promoting a free year of Nintendo Switch Online could draw more viewers to Twitch, then convince them to sign up for Amazon Prime to gain access to Twitch Prime's free games, exclusive loot, and chat room features. Doing so would tether those gamers to Amazon's growing Prime ecosystem, which recently surpassed 100 million members in the US, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). CIRP says that the average Prime member, who already pays $12.99 per month or $119 per year, spends $1,400 on Amazon annually, compared to $600 for nonmembers. This makes growing the prisoner-taking Prime ecosystem a top priority for Amazon, and offering a free one-year subscription to Nintendo Switch Online sweetens the pot.  Image source: Nintendo. Nintendo shipped about 32.5 million Switches worldwide since the hybrid console's launch two years ago. Sales of the Switch were initially robust, but cooled off over the past year due to the saturation of the current-gen console market. The company initially planned to sell 20 million units for the full fiscal year (which ended on March 31) to hit 38 million total shipments. However, it slashed its full-year target to 17 million in January, due to weaker-than-expected holiday sales, and could provide even softer guidance when i t report s its full-year earnings on April 25. Sales of Switch hardware, accessories, and software accounted for 90% of Nintendo's sales last quarter. On the bright side, Nintendo will reportedly launch a new version of the Switch in the second half of the year to shore up its hardware sales. Until that happens, it makes sense for Nintendo to convince more Switch players to sign up for Nintendo Switch Online in order to boost its revenue per gamer. Nintendo only launched the service last September, but it's already topped over 8 million paid subscribers. That only represents about a quarter of the Switch's installed base, so there's plenty of room for the service to grow. Therefore, it makes strategic sense for Nintendo to offer its plan as a temporary perk for Prime members. Amazon and Nintendo's partnership looks like a win-win deal for both companies. The former gains more Prime members while promoting Twitch Prime, and the latter captures more Nintendo Switch Online subscribers as its hardware sales decelerate. If it's a success, we might see Amazon and Nintendo make similar cross-industry deals to reach more gamers in the future.  10 stocks we like better than Nintendo

242," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Roku (NASDAQ:
ROKU
) started April and the new quarter on the same positive footing it had throughout the first quarter. On Apr.3, it reached an intraday high of $71.77. However, since then, Roku stock has been giving up some of its recent gains.  While I would not bet against Roku shares longer-term (year-to-date, Roku Inc stock is up over 99%), in the next few weeks, the stock is unlikely to go above $77.77 - its 52-week high, which it saw on Oct. 1. There might be further short-term profit-taking in ROKU, potentially offering investors better entry points if they decide to hit the buy button later in the quarter. With all of that in mind, let's look at what may be next for Roku stock. The streaming device platform Roku, which also is the leading connected TV manufacturer in the U.S., became a darling of Wall Street soon after its IPO in 2017. The price of Roku stock initially went up from an opening price of $15.78 to a high of $77 in just over a year, benefiting from the disruptive internet entertainment revolution that has made viewing more personalized. Then came the selloff in the last quarter of 2018 - especially in the tech sector - which was seen as an important signal that investors were no longer willing to be exuberant with technology stocks and their rich valuation numbers. Roku's earnings report on Feb. 22 pleased Wall Street. Its platform segment, which accounts for the bulk of the company's sales, consists of advertising, licensing and other non-hardware revenue sources. Its Q4 2018 earnings beat analyst estimates and the company provided guidance that came above expectations for 2019. The earnings were at 5 cents per share compared to 3 cents expected by analysts. Its revenue grew to $275.7 million, up 46% year-over-year. Roku's accelerating growth led to a net income of $6.8 million. In its efforts to hit the $1 billion mark, Roku management is looking at international expansion as the next strategic area of growth. The company aims to grow the number of countries it operates in and to add local content to attract international viewers. Roku is a growth stock, but it's also a speculative stock. Long-term ROKU bulls happily highlight many of Roku's competitive advantages, starting with ROKU's share of smart TVs sold in the U.S. and projected annual growth of over 30% in the rapidly expanding over-the-top streaming market. On the opposing side of the coin are the nervous investors and short-sellers who are looking for any excuse to short Roku stock. Unlike Netflix (NASDAQ:
NFLX
), Roku does not generate content. This is another reason why some investors worry that Roku's revenue growth through subscriptions may simply be not enough to justify the rich valuation. ROKU is facing increasing competition from tech rivals such as Alphabet's (NASDAQ:
GOOG
, NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) Chromecast, Apple's (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) Apple TV, and Amazon's (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) Fire TV. Disney  (NYSE:
DIS
) is also launching its own streaming service soon. As these competitors continue to make their mark in the marketplace in 2019, investors may decide to have a wait-and-see attitude, pressuring the recent price gains. Doubtful analysts further point out that the hefty valuations for Roku Inc stock would be hit in case of an economic slowdown. If the broader market does not go up as rapidly as it has done over the past years, then the momentum in high-flying stocks like ROKU would slow down, too. If Roku cannot keep up with the aggressive growth assumptions, then shareholders may become more concerned with low profits as well as its margins and the stock price could easily suffer. ROKU stock's 52-week price range has been $26.30 (Dec. 24, 2018)-$ 77.57 (Oct. 1, 2018). In the coming weeks, I expect its price to be a battleground between investors and traders. As a result of the impressive Q1 price gains, short-term technical indicators have become over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that ROKU's technical message has also become ""overbought."" Therefore, in mid-March, following an analyst downgrade, it was not surprising to see a rapid fall of 14% in one day on the headlines. While long-term investors would like to see Roku go over the $80 level, traders are likely to keep the range between $75 and $60. Indeed, on Apr. 4, the stock closed at $64.49. Therefore, a further pullback toward the low-$60's or even high-$50's level might occur in ROKU stock in the next few weeks.  If you already own Roku stock, you might want to hold your position. However, within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 5-7% below the current price point. If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may also consider using a  covered call strategy with approximately a three-month time horizon. In that case, you may, for example, buy 100 shares of Roku at a limit price of $65.49 (the closing price on Apr. 4) and, at the same time, sell a ROKU July 19 $65 call option, which currently trades at $8.9. The $64 option is almost at-the-money, offering about 14% downside protection in case of volatility and a decline in Roku Inc stock. This call option would stop trading on July 19, 2019, and expire on July 20. Although I believe ROKU's management will successfully take the necessary steps to grow the company profitably in the long run, I do not think Roku stock will repeat its recent exponential up move in the next few weeks. Thus, investors should not rush to hit the buy button on ROKU shares yet. You may want to wait for the release of the next quarterly statement in May 2019 to re-evaluate the balance sheet and the fundamentals. Well-performing stocks tend to keep on winning, and the recent strength of Roku stock might be a good indication that within three or four years, investors who buy ROKU on the dips are likely to be rewarded handsomely. In the meantime, Roku may also find itself in the middle of a bidding war from the competitors to be acquired. As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

243," By Rami Ayyub and Stephen Farrell JERUSALEM, April 5 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen behind his main challenger in opinion polls ahead of next week's Israeli election but still has an easier path to form a government that would keep him in power for a record fifth term. Netanyahu, who has dominated Israeli politics for a generation, is fighting for his political survival against former top general Benny Gantz, a political novice. And looming criminal indictments against Netanyahu, who has denied any wrongdoing in three cases of alleged bribery and fraud, could cloud his political future and that of any government he might head, possibly leading to a new election. On Friday, the last day polling is allowed, Gantz's centrist Blue and White party was projected to take 30 seats, more than the 26 forecast for Netanyahu's right-wing Likud, according to a poll in Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. But the poll also projected a combined total of 63 seats for the parties in Netanyahu's right-wing bloc, a slim but workable majority. Other polls showed similar results. The coalition arithmetic for Gantz appears far more difficult. Israel's president, Reuven Rivlin, will consult with the leaders of every party represented in parliament and choose whoever he believes has the best chance of forming a coalition. The nominee has up to 42 days to form a government before the president asks another politician to try. In the final stretch of the campaign, Netanyahu cautioned his right-wing supporters against over-confidence: ""It's a close race between right and left,"" he told Israel Radio on Thursday. Gantz appeared invigorated by the polling numbers on Friday, telling his backers they were ""a few metres away from victory"". ""On Tuesday, everything you see here in this country will shift,"" Gantz told a rally in Kiryat Ekron.  SHADOW OF CORRUPTION Netanyahu has fought the campaign under the shadow of the public announcement in February by Israel's attorney general that he intends to indict him. No charges have yet been brought and there will be a pre-trial hearing at which Netanyahu can challenge any findings. If indicted, he is under no obligation to quit, but he would need coalition partners to stand by him to avert a new election. ""Netanyahu's supreme and indeed only imperative will be to cobble together an indictment coalition: one that will make it possible for him to continue to serve even after the hearing and after he's indicted,"" political analyst Yossi Verter wrote in the liberal Israeli daily Ha'aretz on Friday. That could include efforts, promoted by some Netanyahu loyalists, to pass a law to ban the indictment of a sitting prime minister. Some potential coalition allies have publicly balked at such legislation, including at least one cabinet minister - and potential successor - in Netanyahu's own party. Netanyahu's opponents have campaigned hard on the corruption issue, producing posters, car bumper stickers and election rally banners bearing the words ""CRIME MINISTER"".  CAMPAIGN STRATEGY With Israeli-Palestinian peace talks frozen since 2014, personalities and personal attacks have dominated an election campaign that has largely skated over war-and-peace issues that once dominated Israeli political debate. Netanyahu has cast Gantz, a former military chief, as a weak leftist who would endanger Israel's security by giving territorial concessions to the Palestinians. Gantz professes a commitment to peace while giving no clear indication whether he would support the Palestinian goal of statehood in territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war. Netanyahu has also highlighted his close relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, who overturned decades of U.S. policy and international consensus to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognise it as Israel's capital. Netanyahu visited Trump last month. At the meeting, Trump, in what was widely seen as a bid to boost Netanyahu, again broke with long-term policy to recognise Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, also captured in 1967.

244," In response to reporting of fiscal fourth-quarter results that missed the mark, shares of Duluth Holdings (NASDAQ: DLTH) , a retailer that caters to the needs of tradespeople, dropped 23% as of 10:51 a.m. EDT on Friday. Here are the key numbers from the fiscal fourth quarter: Here are the headline numbers from the full fiscal year:  Image source: Getty Images. Duluth's CEO Stephanie Pugliese did her best on the conference call with investors to put some context around the weak fourth-quarter results: Management provided investors with guidance for fiscal 2019: Given the worse-than-expected quarterly numbers and downbeat guidance, it isn't hard to figure out why shares are nosediving today. There aren't many positive takeaways for investors from this earnings report. Sales growth is slowing, margins are falling, and net income is barely moving at all. Will management be able to right the ship as we head into 2019?

245," By Arno Schuetze FRANKFURT, April 5 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank favour a straightforward merger over more complex ways to structure a deal, three people close to the matter said. In their base case scenario, a transaction would be organised as a share offer from Deutsche Bank for Commerzbank, they said. That structure is preferred to the creation of a new holding company, which is viewed as too difficult to execute. Sources said last year that Deutsche Bank was examining creating a holding company structure amid speculation at the time that it could merge with Commerzbank. Last month the two banks confirmed they were in talks about a merger. A preliminary decision on whether they want to go forward is expected within days. The people cautioned that no decision has yet been taken on a potential deal structure and there is still no certainty that a deal will be struck at all. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank declined to comment. Regulators in the United States, Britain and Switzerland tend to favour the bank holding company structure, in part because it can help with the winding down of a troubled bank. There has been a push since the financial crash to make banks easier to break up, lowering the risk that the problems of a troubled investment bank, for instance, could affect ordinary savers. About 90 percent of U.S. banks, including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, operate as holding companies, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve. But converting to a holding company structure can be costly. In Deutsche and Commerzbank's case, defining the relative value of the two banks for a holding structure would be more complicated than simply negotiating a price for a simple takeover, the sources said. As part of a deal, Deutsche Bank will be asked by the European Central Bank to raise fresh funds to plug capital holes resulting from asset revaluations and expected restructuring costs, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier this week. Issues around regulatory capital - and how to make use of the fact that Commerzbank trades well below book level, which can be used to boost such capital - are a talking point between the two banks. Other issues focus on synergies, job cuts as well as legal and tax issues, people familiar with the matter have said. ",24.17999999999938,1

249," By Gina Chon (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.) SAN FRANCISCO, April 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Big Tech could use some schooling on ethics. Alphabet's Google drew so much flak over outside advisers it chose to help it responsibly develop artificial intelligence that it abandoned the effort. Yet it deserves credit for training some staff on the dangers of unintended bias in algorithms and other issues. More outside input, particularly from academia, can help Silicon Valley reduce risk. It's an embarrassment for a company that has been proactive in getting employees to think about unintended consequences of their products. About 100 Googlers have participated in training based on a technology ethics project at Santa Clara University. It provides case studies, like creating a virtual assistant to help corporate executives, and challenges students to get out of their bubble and question assumptions. It also recommends remembering the ""terrible people"" who might steal, abuse or hack a product. Other universities offer similar courses. Stanford's has computer science students examine real world situations, like bias in bail algorithms used by judges or privacy issues arising from parents posting pictures of their kids on Instagram. Harvard and MIT teamed up last year to offer instruction on the ethics and governance of AI. These initiatives are useful because technology can embed the prejudices of its human designers. Blacks and Hispanics hold only 13 percent of engineering jobs while women have about 14 percent, according to 2018 Pew Research Center data. That matters as tech takes over increasingly complex decisions from people, such as facial-recognition programs used by law enforcement. The cries of bias against Silicon Valley are also getting louder. In a discrimination lawsuit brought by the Department of Housing and Urban Development last week, Facebook was accused of allowing advertisers to target ads based on race and religion. Coders and executives should recognize why that's wrong. It's a teachable moment for Big Tech. On Twitter  CONTEXT NEWS - Alphabet's Google said on April 4 that it was dissolving its Advanced Technology External Advisory Council, which was charged with examining ethical issues related to artificial intelligence and other advanced technology. - As of April 5, about 2,500 technology industry employees, researchers, academics and others had signed a letter calling on Google to remove Kay Coles James, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, from the council that Google announced on March 26. - The group that signed the letter is protesting James' views on transgender, lesbian and gay individuals. James has criticized proposals that she tweeted would ""open every female bathroom and sports team to biological males."" Critics also opposed the appointment of Dyan Gibbens, chief executive of Trumbull Unmanned, a drone company that works with the Defense Department. ""It's become clear that in the current environment, ATEAC can't function as we wanted,"" Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs, said in a statement. - Carnegie Mellon University professor Alessandro Acquisti tweeted on March 30 that he declined an invitation to join the council, saying it wasn't the right forum for him. - The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on March 28 charged Facebook with violating the Fair Housing Act by encouraging, enabling and causing housing discrimination in advertising on its platforms.

250," The cannabis-related ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ has been outperforming this year so far, surging about 46%. The surge was driven by easing of rules and regulations on the highly guarded drug for recreational and medical usage (read: ETFs That Topped & Flopped in Q1 ).

In fact, its popularity has been rising since Canada legalized recreational cannabis last year and become the second country in the world to do so on a national level. Additionally, a number of states in United States have also joined the race of marijuana legalization. The White House, Congress and U.S. regulators have also softened their stance on the drug's legalization. All these developments have injected strong optimism into the emerging marijuana industry, spurring deal activities and pushing marijuana stocks higher.

The tremendous success of the pot industry is showing no signs of slowdown with short-sellers piling up heavy losses. That said, short-selling of the stocks also led to the spike in the MJ ETF.

Inside The Short-Selling Mechanism

Short selling or securities lending is another revenue stream for ETF issuers through which they can make additional money. Securities lending is a practice where mutual funds and ETFs pay agents to lend out underlying components in the funds to other traders and thereby earn interest. ETF providers typically lend out securities to investors who want to short a stock. Investors borrow shares from the provider and sell them on the market, hoping that they will be able to repurchase the same at a lower price in the market, thereby gaining from the spread.

Per Bloomberg , while many ETFs engage in securities lending, it's been a particularly lucrative practice for pot funds as many cannabis stocks have a small public float and aren't readily available to borrow. The funds charge a fee to borrow the shares, generating additional income that can help boost their performance. Pot securities cost about 15% to borrow versus typical rates closer to 1% for more prosaic shares. But borrowing fees can rise to as high as 110% for popular short targets like Tilray Inc TLRY (read: Tilray Earnings Impressive: More Reasons to Buy Marijuana ETFs ).

Marijuana ETF can lend out 33% of their holdings, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Income from short sellers added 0.58 percentage point to MJ's overall performance in the first three months of the year, according to Sam Masucci, chief executive of ETF Managers Group, which runs the fund.

Some of the most shorted cannabis stocks include Tilray, Canopy Growth CGC , Cronos Group CRON , Aphria APHA and Aurora Cannabis ACB (read: Marijuana ETF Outperforms in Q1: 6 Stocks Leading the Rally ).

Let's take a closer look at the fundamentals of MJ.

MJ in Focus

This is the first and only ETF focusing on the cannabis/marijuana industry. It tracks the Prime Alternative Harvest Index, designed to measure the performance of companies within the cannabis ecosystem, benefiting from global medicinal and recreational cannabis legalization initiatives. The fund holds 37 securities in its basket with higher concentration on the top firms. Canadian firms make up 62% of the portfolio, while American firms comprise 24.2%. The ETF has AUM of $1.2 billion and trades in a solid volume of around 928,000 shares. It charges 75 basis points in annual fees (read: Marijuana ETF Joins Billion Dollar Club ).

252," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Let's start with my summary statement - Nielsen Holdings (NYSE:
NLSN
) stock has been falling for years but the trend could flip soon. There is technical tension building that could cause a rally in the near term. This is not the same as saying buy it here, though.  I am not a fan of catching falling knives unless there is a clear vision of why the stock is falling and of how the company is addressing the problems that are causing the slippage. Not all stocks that are sliding are catchable. Today I examine the opportunity, if there is one, in NLSN stock. While the S&P 500 is near its all-time highs, NLSN stock is stuck near its all-time lows. Clearly there is something wrong that Wall Street, as bullish as it is, wants nothing to do with it. Before Netflix (NASDAQ:
NFLX
) completely changed the way the world consumes media, NLSN stock's world was easy to understand. People watched set-top boxes and if you monitored those, you get the idea of what are the viewer habits. Now we all want to consume our media by streaming it, and that is a world has hundreds of ways of doing it. This number is also growing. But perhaps more importantly, unless Nielson finds a way to offer different value, measuring streaming consumption is easier now for the companies that provide it that perhaps they don't need outside help to understand their clients. Meaning NLSN services are almost obsolete now. When I try to catch stocks that cannot find a bottom, I look for value. But here, after all these years in existence, NLSN stock still loses money. This means that there is literally no tangible value to find. So I would need to do it on faith and that is a leap I can't take. Yes, I am not a fan of buying Nielsen stock here unless I know something that the consensus doesn't. So what if I already own the shares, is it time to get out? That depends on the reason investors bought the stock. Usually I bail on my position if the reason that bought is no longer there or if I see an imminent threat to price regardless of my conviction in my thesis.  So that leaves the technical evaluation of NLSN stock to be the arbiter. Nielson has been trading in a three-year-long descending channel of prices. This means that it has been setting lower highs and lower lows relentlessly since 2016. The saving grace here is that the pattern may be changing. Since last July, NLSN, while it continued to set lower highs, it stopped making lower lows. In fact there is a mini trend of three higher lows. So we now have two separate and opposite trend lines. When they meet, there will be a lot of energy built into the stock. This tight situation will then need to resolve itself in a big move. The problem is that the direction of said move is unknown here … but since we are at all-time lows, it is perhaps more likely that not that it will bounce and start a recover rally. This, to me, is still more guessing than investing so it's definitely not for me. But if I were already holding the stock this long it might not be the best place to sell it before seeing the results of this descending wedge breakout. It is important to note that the shorter-term price action has been violent of late because of headlines. In late March, the stock cratered because of a Credit Suisse downgrade. But NLSN has since closed the gap from that on rumors of buyouts. So clearly there is more insider homework necessary here before making better fundamental reasons to own NLSN shares. Meanwhile the technical trade is brewing and with the added support of a buyout rumor increases the odds of the descending wedge breaking out rather than down.

256," By Richard Lough DINARD, France, April 5 (Reuters) - International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney will help lead a British-Canadian push to defend journalists from attacks and restrictions around the world, ministers said on Friday. She was named co-chair of a legal panel that will draw up proposals to counter laws that hinder reporters. More than 60 journalists were killed in 2018 according to Reporters Without Borders, more than half of them targeted deliberately, with the murder of Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi in particular drawing international condemnation. Britain's foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, told the event that democratic states needed to make it ""an international taboo of the highest order"" to murder, arrest or detain journalists for doing their jobs. Hunt, who appeared alongside his Canadian counterpart Chrystia Freeland, also named Clooney as his special envoy on media freedom. ""When journalists are not able to question those in authority, hold them to account, freely and with impunity then you start a slippery slope to the closed societies that none of us want to see growing in influence,"" he said. Last year, Clooney joined the legal team representing two Reuters journalists who were convicted under Myanmar's official secrets act and sentenced to seven years in prison. On Friday, she said only one in ten countries enjoyed a free press. The legal panel, she added, could propose reforms of national laws that run counter to international standards, such as blasphemy legislation, and encourage governments to give journalists more consular protection abroad. The proposals will not be legally binding. While Khashoggi's death sparked global outrage, human rights groups criticised the meek response of many Western capitals, many of which cited the importance of trade relations for not adopting a tougher stance with Saudi Arabia.

268," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Editor's note: This story was previously published in February 2019. It has since been updated and republished. The benefit of fast-growing stocks is self-evident, but as inflation becomes something to start worrying about, fast-growing stocks have an importance tied to timing. If you haven't noticed, there has been a lot of talk about something that we haven't heard about for almost a decade, inflation. For nearly a decade, the Federal Reserve and all the central banks in all the industrialized nations have been managing interest rates to keep them outrageously low until the financial system had a chance to right itself. Now, we're in the next phase of that great experiment. Economies are coming back online and central banks are raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay while not shutting off the green shoots of growth. But this isn't a science. It's a bit messy. It means that growth will be more uneven than it has been in the past. You need to find firms with solid sales earnings growth as well as technical and fundamental strengths to keep the profits rolling. These are seven fast-growing stocks to buy today that will keep you in good stead for years to come.  Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE:
KRO
) has a $1.69 billion market cap and is a very focused firm. It produces titanium dioxide (TiO2). The thing is, TiO2 has a very practical purpose that is used in a number of industries; it provides whiteness, brightness and opacity. As one of the leading providers of TiO2 in Europe and the U.S., its product is used in paints, coloring agents, plastics, rubber, silicone, ceramics, glass, the list goes on. It's a basic building block for an enormous amount of industrial and commercial applications. And as growth resumes and more products are sold, KRO will benefit by supplying a key ingredient to many of those products. Besides being one of our favorite a fast-growing stocks KRO also hands out a 5% dividend and trades at a sub-9 price-earnings ratio.  Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:
SHW
) has sold paint and coatings now for 152 years. That's a pretty impressive record. But it's a bit unusual to see a paint company in a list of top growth stocks. Usually, it's some cloud storage firm or a breakout online retailer. However, SHW, by its size and reputation, has not only endured but it has positioned itself on top of the coatings heap. It grew from annual sales of $400,000 in 1866 to annual sales topping $15 billion last year, coming from over 100 countries around the world. Its size, scope and quality is one reason hardware giant Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:
LOW
) inked a deal to be the only nationwide home seller to offer SHW products. This is even more exciting given that housing demand is back on track and the interest in homeowners to fixing up their current houses.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:
VRTX
) is one of the leading pharmaceuticals firms when it comes to treating cystic fibrosis (CF). That may not seem like much of a franchise given all the other more compelling diseases out there, but VRTX has built a $48 billion market cap in the sector and most of its competitors are looking for other places to find an opening. That is a big deal for pharma companies that usually are strong until patents run down or generics start eating into margins. Not so with VRTX. As new approvals keep rolling in for next-generation CF drugs, it has plenty more in the pipeline to keep this growth going.  Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:
VLO
) is one of the top refiners in the U.S. It now has 15 oil refineries which supply 3.1 million barrels per day, and its 11 ethanol plants deliver 1.4 billion gallons of ethanol per year. Its operations now stretch across the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Ireland. When the economy is in a growth phase, refineries are a great place to have your money. They are one of the leading economic indicators since demand for fuel is a key sign more the economy is coming back. More demand for fuel means there's more transportation of goods and services. There's no doubt that refining is as cyclical as most parts of the energy sector, but when times are good, they're very good. And times are getting better every day in the energy patch.  Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:
RDS.A
, NYSE:
RDS.B
) is one of the biggest players in the global energy markets. With a $284 billion market cap, the only Big Oil that's bigger is Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:
XOM
). It's what is called an integrated energy company because it has operations from the fields to the pipelines to the refineries to the distribution. As with all energy firms, when times are bad, the more exposure you have to the entire production and distribution process, the tougher things get. But at the size the big oils are, they have the money to wait out the bad patches. And that's just what RDS.A has done. Now it's time to cash in. What's more, RDS.A is still delivering a mouth-watering 5.9% dividend, but that may wane as the stock price starts rising. In the meanwhile, it's easy to see why this is one of our picks for the best fast-growing stocks.  Lumentum Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:
LITE
) is a specialty company that focuses on laser beams. It's one of the biggest optical and photonics companies in the world that is working on the 3D sensing sector. Essentially, 3D sensing is basically the gesture sensing that we all have become accustomed with in our mobile devices, screens in our cars, etc. It is one of the most ubiquitous aspects of our interactive age and one of the key parts of the Internet of Things (IoT) concept. What's more, LITE is also a major player in the optical networking space that makes the infrastructure that makes our world ""smarter,"" operating in as close to real time as possible. It's crucial for the next generation of cloud computing and network operations. Its laser division helps build the next generation of equipment that makes all this possible.  Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc (NYSE:
KNX
) had its humble beginnings in 1966, taking steel from the Port of Los Angeles to Arizona and bringing cotton from Arizona to LA. Today, KNX is a $5.78 billion business with 20,000 trucks on the road throughout the U.S. and Mexico. If you see a Swift logo on a truck while driving, it's a KNX truck. Charles Dow, the inspiration for the Dow Jones Industrial Average , also inspired a fundamental theory about the economy and the markets. It's simply called Dow Theory. One of the core tenants is that if you look at the transportation and the industrial sectors, you can predict how well the economy will be doing in the near future. If the transport business is rising, that's a bullish sign that the economy is on an upswing and KNX stock with it. Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

290," The iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (CRBN) made its debut on 12/08/2014, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market. What Are Smart Beta ETFs? Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry. Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way. If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies. These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics. Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results. Fund Sponsor & Index The fund is managed by Blackrock. CRBN has been able to amass assets over $433.51 M, making it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. CRBN seeks to match the performance of the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index before fees and expenses. The MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index is designed to address two dimensions of carbon exposure ? carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves. Cost & Other Expenses Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same. Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for this ETF, which makes it one of the least expensive products in the space. It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 2.18%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. When you look at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 2.04% of the fund's total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN). CRBN's top 10 holdings account for about 10.95% of its total assets under management. Performance and Risk The ETF has gained about 15.27% so far this year and it's up approximately 4.37% in the last one year (as of 04/05/2019). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $99 and $120.83. CRBN has a beta of 0.97 and standard deviation of 11.96% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a low risk choice in the space. With about 1305 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

291," If you're interested in broad exposure to the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market, look no further than the WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Earnings Fund (EES), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 02/23/2007. The fund is sponsored by Wisdomtree. It has amassed assets over $767.14 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market. Why Small Cap Value Sitting at a market capitalization below $2 billion, small cap companies tend to be high-potential stocks compared to its large and mid cap counterparts, but come with higher risk. Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets. Costs Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.38%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.56%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector--about 23.70% of the portfolio. Financials and Industrials round out the top three. Looking at individual holdings, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY) accounts for about 1.08% of total assets, followed by American Axle & Manufacturing (AXL) and Warrior Met Coal Inc (HCC). The top 10 holdings account for about 8.57% of total assets under management. Performance and Risk EES seeks to match the performance of the WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Earnings Index before fees and expenses. The WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Earnings Index is a fundamentally weighted index that measures the performance o f earnings -generating companies within the small-capitalization segment of the U.S. Stock Market. The ETF has added roughly 15.95% so far this year and was up about 4.76% in the last one year (as of 04/05/2019). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $30.28 and $40.77. The ETF has a beta of 1.16 and standard deviation of 15.73% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 861 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. Alternatives WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Earnings Fund sports a Zacks ETF Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. EES, then, is not a great choice for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are better ETFs in the space to consider. The iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $9.30 B in assets, Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF has $13.40 B. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.24% and VBR charges 0.07%. Bottom-Line While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

292," On Apr 4, we issued an updated research report on Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. IRWD . This biopharmaceutical company, based in Cambridge, MA, is focused on the development and commercialization of treatments primarily addressing gastrointestinal (""GI"") diseases. The company's sole marketed drug, Linzess, is indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (""CIC""). We remind investors that Ironwood co-develops and co-commercializes Linzess and equally shares Linzess U.S. collaboration profits/losses as well as development costs with Allergan AGN . In April 2018, the company has separated its Soluble Guanylate Cyclase (sGC) business into a new entity named Cyclerion Therapeutics. Shares of the company have rallied 22.2% so far this year compared with the industry 's rise of 19.3%.  Linzess Remains Impressive Sales of Linzess were encouraging in 2018 as well. Total revenues for 2018 increased 16.2% year over year to $346.6 million primarily on the back of strong sales of Linzess. The drug's sales rose more than 9% in 2018. Prescriptions filled in 2018 were also up almost 7% year over year. In January 2019, Linzess received approval in China for IBS-C. The company along with its partner, AstraZeneca AZN , will launch the drug in China in the second half of 2019. This is likely to boost Ironwood's top line. The company also earns by selling linaclotide (Linzess) active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to Japan-based Astellas Pharma. Ironwood Pharma generated almost $70.4 million from this transaction in 2018 compared with $29.7 million in the year-ago period. Astellas Pharma started commercializing Linzess in Japan for IBS-C in early 2017. Pipeline Progress Ironwood and Allergan are conducting a phase III study to evaluate Linzess in additional abdominal symptoms including bloating and discomfort in adult patients with IBS-C. A label expansion in pediatric patients is also being planned. A phase IIb study is evaluating MD-7246, a delayed-release formulation of Linzess, as a treatment for all subtypes of IBS, including IBS-C, IBS with diarrhea and IBS-mixed. The company is also developing another GI candidate, IW-3718, in phase III studies for treating persistent refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (""GERD""). Cyclerion Spin-off On Apr 1, Ironwood completed the previously announced separation of its sGC business and transferred the sGC pipeline for the treatment of serious and orphan diseases to newly-formed Cyclerion. This will help Ironwood to focus on its GI pipeline. Ironwood started reducing its workforce following the separation, which is likely to boost margins going forward. The company also reduced employees in 2018 related to separation of business as well as termination of lesinurad license with AstraZeneca. Although the separation of business will increase selling, general and administrative expense, research and development expenses are likely to decrease due to transfer of sGC pipeline in 2019. Our Take The spin-off of sGC pipeline and focus on developing GI pipeline is a positive for Ironwood. It will help the company invest more resources for the development of its GI candidate. Label expansion of Linzess will further boost the prospects of the drug. However, we note that Ironwood is primarily dependent on Linzess for revenues. Any setback related to manufacturing or commercialization of the drug will impact the company's top line. The competition in target markets for Linzess is also increasing. Other available products include Takeda Pharma's TAK Amitiza, Takeda's Motegrity and Synergy's (now a part of   Bausch Health Companies) Trulance, Linzess also faces competition from laxatives and over-the-counter fiber supplements. Pricing pressure also hurts revenues from Linzess. Moreover, Ironwood's GI pipeline is years away from commercialization.  Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price  Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

294," LONDON, April 5 (IFR) - Verizon took advantage of a S&P outlook change and the tightest spreads in the euro market this year to raise €3.08bn-equivalent across euros and sterling on Tuesday. The telecommunications company jumped into the market a day after S&P switched the outlook on its BBB+ rating to positive from stable, citing positive delevering progress. And with average euro corporate spreads at a 2019 low of 80.6bp over swaps at the time of the issue - nearly 26bp tighter year-to-date, according to iBoxx data - the stars aligned. Proceeds will go towards repaying short-term debt, a lead syndicate banker said. Verizon has one of the largest corporate debt stacks in the world - with total debt of US$187bn and bond maturities of US$104.5bn, according to Refinitiv data. S&P said it could upgrade the company if it maintains leverage below 2.5x. On Verizon's latest earnings call, executives said net debt to Ebitda was 2.3x. Verizon also carries Baa1/A- ratings from Moody's/Fitch (both stable). The company has been trying to steer clear of investors in the US dollar market, bar a Green bond earlier this year, so as not to overload them. But while the company is not looking to lever up, it does want to tidy up the front end of its curve, the lead said. AB InBev, another company with a hefty debt stack, completed a similar clean-up the week before. Verizon is also following a long line of its US peers that have been jostling to take out funding in euros in a bid to diversify. US companies have now issued over €31.7bn in euros year-to-date, according to IFR data as of Friday. Last year, that number was just €3.4bn over the same period. ""The euro market is pricing competitively to dollars,"" the syndicate banker said. Most US companies are targeting the euro market rather than sterling. Verizon was last in both the euro and sterling markets in 2017, when it priced a €4.7bn-equivalent four-trancher with tenors from nine to 20 years. Companies have been opportunistically dipping into the sterling market as rates tank on worries about a no-deal Brexit. The yield on 10-year Gilts slipped under 1% on March 25 for the first time since September 2017. On the day of Verizon's issue, it was 1.02%. ""The market revalues, readjusts and moves on,"" the lead banker said. ""Investors and issuers are seeing Brexit more as a rates question than a credit question,"" a banker away said.

295," Shares of auto parts supplier Lear (NYSE: LEA) fell 10.8% in March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence , after an analyst downgraded the stock and voiced concerns about the growth of the company's electronics segment. Wall Street can't make up its mind on Lear. The company, a manufacturer of automotive seating and electronic systems, saw its shares decline by more than 30% in 2018 over concerns that the U.S. automotive market has peaked and worries that electronics suppliers will be forced to dramatically increase spending  to develop technologies for hybrid and electric vehicles.  Automotive seat production line. Image source: Lear. The shares rebounded from that lousy 2018 performance with a 25.3% gain in January , but hit the brakes in mid-March after Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner downgraded the company to hold from buy and cut his price target for the shares. Rosner said he has concerns about the growth and margin trajectory of Lear's tech unit, noting that the E-systems business has seen margin compression and faces a shrinking backlog. Lear shares have gained back what they lost in March in the first few trading days in April, and the stock is once again up 21% for the year. On April 2, the company announced it would buy automotive software supplier Xevo for $320 million to supplement its tech portfolio. This is a dangerous time to be invested in automakers and their suppliers due to fears that a slowing global economy will eat into sales. But Lear CEO Raymond E. Scott on a January call with investors  insisted Lear is well-positioned to weather any global slowdown. ""We have never been in a better competitive position or had more financial flexibility than we have today,"" Scott said.

296," BRUSSELS, April 5 (Reuters) - European Union envoys on Friday discussed options for granting Britain another Brexit delay next week. A Brussels official said Donald Tusk's proposal for a postponement of up to a year had gained support, but national diplomats said all options were still open. EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Wednesday must decide by unanimity on any further delay. British Prime Minister Theresa May asked the bloc on Friday for a second postponement until June 30, with the possibility of leaving earlier. ""Discussion showed wide support for Tusk's idea of a long 'flextension',"" the EU official said on condition of anonymity. EU leaders only two weeks ago rejected a request from May for a reprieve until June 30 and several national diplomats said all options were still on the table - from refusing a further delay and heading towards a no-deal Brexit to granting May's request or pushing for a long postponement. ""We are waiting to see if there is any real progress with Labour. Depending on what May comes with on Wednesday, how much clarity there is on the UK side, we still have the three options,"" said another EU diplomat briefed on the meeting. ""Accepting her request is tough for some in the EU. June 30 is as tricky as it was two weeks ago because of the sensitivities around the European Parliament elections ... A long delay is a way of reducing uncertainty and avoiding constant emergency Brexit summits."" May has accepted that Britain will have to prepare to elect members of the European Parliament, but hopes to leave the bloc in time to pull out of polling. As was the case two weeks ago, May will address the other 27 national EU leaders and answer their questions before leaving the room and letting them decide. The last time, she left them with the sense that she did not control the situation or have a clear plan, hardening the line of EU states such as France that say Brexit uncertainty must end as soon as possible, even if this means an abrupt split. ""It is really a political decision for our leaders on the next steps from the EU side,"" said a senior EU diplomat who took part in the closed-door meeting. EU diplomats stressed the need for ""sincere cooperation"" clauses in case of any long Brexit delay, to ensure Britain does not interfere unduly with the EU's reforms, its next budget, European Parliament elections or selecting the new executive Commission. ""For any kind of extension, the leaders want more clarification of the purpose ... If it is to hold another vote on the Withdrawal Agreement, this is clear. But if not, the leaders would want to know exactly what the reason would be,"" the senior diplomat said. ",24.17999999999938,1

298," The market expects PNC Financial Services (PNC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when i t report s results for the quarter ended March 2019. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 12. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This regional bank operator is expected to pos t quarterly earnings of $2.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.6%. Revenues are expected to be $4.25 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.22% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PNC Financial Services? For PNC Financial Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.67%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PNC Financial Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PNC Financial Services would pos t earnings of $2.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.75, delivering a surprise of -0.72%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. PNC Financial Services doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Wells Fargo would pos t earnings of $1.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.21, delivering a surprise of +3.42%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Wells Fargo doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.",24.17999999999938,1
301," Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when First Republic Bank (FRC) reports results for the quarter ended March 2019. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 12. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This San Francisco bank is expected to pos t quarterly earnings of $1.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.9%. Revenues are expected to be $813.99 million, up 12.9% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.23% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for First Republic Bank? For First Republic Bank, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.29%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination indicates that First Republic Bank will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the las t report ed quarter, it was expected that First Republic Bank would pos t earnings of $1.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.29, delivering a surprise of +4.03%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

The  Unemployment Rate  was unchanged from the previous two months at an historically low 3.8%. This data is provided monthly by the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) . This marks a healthy bounce-back from February's disappointing headline, which has been upwardly revised to 33K. January's revision was also increased by 1000 jobs. In all, an additional 14K new jobs have been brought to the revisions, and the 3-month moving average for BLS job gains is 180K. Healthcare once again led the way by industry, with 49K new jobs in March. A continually aging baby boomer population ensures that this will be a strong jobs driver for years to come.

Labor Force Participation  slipped a tad to 63.0%, while the U-6 (aka ""real unemployment"") was unchanged at 7.3%, also an historically low total.

The metal was down about 0.1 percent so far for the week. U.S. employment growth accelerated from a 17-month low in March as milder weather boosted activity in sectors like construction, which could further allay fears of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter, driving early gains on Wall Street.

Security Measures for Users in Australia

Facebook is working with an international news agency, Agence France-Presse (AFP) to launch a fact-checking program in Australia. The program will help the company easily identify false content and lower its view rate by placing it in the bottom of the News Feed.

Additionally, Facebook has increased its investments in both people and technology to take down fake accounts, which are primarily responsible for the creation of misleading content.

Notably, the company recently took down a few fake accounts after Kate Washington, an Australian politician, identified them.

Facebook has also updated its Ad Library containing all active ads on Facebook and the Pages that feature them. The Library also includes details such as the Page creation date and ""primary country of people who manage Pages with large audiences.""

However, Facebook does not require advertisers in the country to present necessary documents, before placing political ads, per Guardian .

Regulations Tightened

Representatives from across the globe are coming up with strict regulations to keep a check on social media content.

Australia recently approved new laws for social media companies lay down huge fines and jail terms for executives if they fail to quickly remove violent content, per Reuters. Additionally, Facebook and Alphabet's GOOGL are facing increased scrutiny from Australia's competition regulator over their dominance in online ads and news.

Indonesian government took a similar stance by threatening to shut down Facebook if it found any external interference during elections. Facebook employees in the country could be imprisoned for up to 12 years or fined by as much as $871,000 if they were found involved in breaching the rules.

Moreover, the European Union (EU) brought into effect General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules on May 25, 2018, which placed tights control on how companies deal with user data. Failing to abide by the rules will attract huge fines.

Further, the Election Commission of India (EC) mandated Facebook, Twitter TWTR and Google to follow the code of conduct for transparency in political ads.

Zacks Rank & a Key Pick

Facebook currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

315," Compared to the first quarter of 2018, international equity funds witnessed better growth in the first quarter of 2019. Improving macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions as well as healthy corporate earnings around the globe played a pivotal role in shaping up the international equity market in Q1. China, in particular, led the way in the developing world, courtesy of encouraging developments on the trade war front as well as China's economic resilience. Non-U.S. mutual funds provide excellent choices for those looking to diversify their investments across a wide range of foreign countries, including both emerging and developed nations. Thus, investing in non-U.S. mutual funds may prove profitable and more attractive than those with significant domestic exposure at this point. Non-U.S. Equity Groups Led Gains in Q1 Given the improving investment climate across the globe, international equity markets performed well in the first quarter. Among the six non-U.S. style box Morningstar Categories, foreign large-growth category and foreign small/mid-growth category delivered the highest returns, edging up 12% and 11.7%, respectively in the period between Jan 1 and Mar 27. In the first quarter, the Europe stock category increased 10.5% compared with Japan's rally of only 8.1%. Notably, the Japan stock category lagged every other international stock category save for Latin American and Indian equity groups, which returned 4.1% and 3.4%, respectively. Not-so-surprisingly, China posted the biggest gain in the first quarter, returning 18.2%. This followed severe losses that the stock group suffered in 2018. Trade War Optimism and Upbeat Economic Data from China Per a report by Financial Times, trade negotiations between the United States and China are almost over. The report quoted executive vice president for international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Myron Brilliant as saying that almost 90% of the deal is done, but the last 10% is the hardest part, it's the trickiest part and it will require trade-offs on both sides."" Further, in a tweet on the morning of Apr 4, President Donald Trump stated that trade talks with China were ""moving along nicely."" Meanwhile, Caixin's China services purchasing managers index, a measure of the Asian giant's private sector performance, increased to 54.4 in March, a 14-month high. The rise was supported by increase in new export orders. Market watchers welcomed such developments. Also, China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for March increased to 50.8 from 49.9 in February. This was its fastest expansion in eight months. 4 Best Funds to Buy Now Given such circumstances, we have highlighted four international equity mutual funds carrying a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that are poised to gain from such factors.

320," PARIS, April 5 (Reuters) - France's Societe Generale plans to cut about 600 jobs at its investment banking unit in Paris and a few hundred more in London and New York, a source at the bank said on Friday. SocGen's Chief Executive Frederic Oudea said two months ago the bank would cut costs by 500 million euros ($561 million) at its corporate and investment banking business after the unit's profits fell by more than half in the fourth quarter. The bank intends to shift its focus to activities such as equity derivatives, scaling back its fixed-income, currencies and commodities business. ""The job cuts will be carried out through voluntary departures,"" a union representative said on Friday. ""This would affect corporate and investment banking jobs as well as people working for dedicated support functions,"" the representative added. A bank spokesman declined to comment. SocGen Deputy CEO Severin Cabannes, who oversees the corporate and investment banking unit which employs 18,000 people in 30 countries, said in February the restructuring plan would likely include job cuts, but he said it was too early to evaluate how many. In February, the bank fired its head of trading, Frank Drouet, replacing him with Jean-Francois Gregoire, the deputy chief risk officer. After years of low interest rates curtailed returns for retail banking, SocGen, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and other big European banks have relied on the more volatile earnings from corporate and investment banking. Although shares of other major European banks have bounced back this year, SocGen shares are still down three percent. The stock has lost 39 percent over the past 12 months. Oudea, who lowered the bank's profitability targets on Feb. 7 for the third time since he took the helm in 2008, is under pressure from investors and has said the bank will sell more assets than originally planned, mainly in Eastern Europe, to boost the bank's equity ratios. The board has recommended shareholders vote in favour of a new four-year term as CEO at a general meeting next month. ($1 = 0.8906 euros) ",24.17999999999938,1

Pfizer also gained marketing approval in EU for its new lung cancer medicine, Vizimpro (dacomitinib) that was approved in the United States last September. Vizimpro (dacomitinib), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is now approved in EU for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with EGFR activating mutations. Novartis' New Immunology Acquisition: Novartis announced plans to acquire IFM Tre , a subsidiary of Boston-based IFM Therapeutics, for an upfront payment of $310 million upfront. In addition, IFM will also be eligible to earn up to $1.265 billion in milestone payments. The deal will give Novartis full rights to IFM's two NLRP3 inhibitors - one clinical and two preclinical. These medicines target the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune system, thereby providing a novel approach to preventing chronic inflammation that results in serious disease. The deal complements Novartis' existing pipeline of anti-inflammatory medicines. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019.

Novartis also notified of a dispute with Amgen relating to their collaboration agreement for the newly launched migraine medicine, Aimovig. Novartis said that Amgen issued a notice of termination of the agreement on Apr 2.

Following the improved manufacturing process, it was observed that the incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) in the study was lower than previous phase III studies. In the MAPLE study, the reported incidence of IOI was 8.9%, which was less than around 15% observed in the previous studies, SEQUOIA and CEDAR. The companies plan to file a biologics license application (BLA) for abicipar in the first half of 2019. Pfizer/Sangmo Announce Promising Data on Gene Therapy Candidate : Pfizer and its partner, Sangamo Therapeutics announced encouraging interim data from a phase I/II study evaluating their gene therapy candidate, SB-525, for treating hemophilia A.

Dose dependent increase in factor VIII levels was observed in eight patients treated with SB-525 gene therapy across the four dosage cohorts. Excess levels of factor VIII increase blood clotting, which is a major symptom of haemophilia.

323," The Allstate Corporation ALL is in talks with FGL Holdings FG to sell-off its annuity business, per Reuters. Notably, the company has been looking for options to get rid of this business due to disappointing returns. Allstate's annuities segment accounted for about 2.4% of total revenues and 0.2% of  total policies in force in 2018. The segment consists of deferred fixed annuities and immediate fixed annuities. The segment is in run-off and focused on increasing lifetime economic value. Both the deferred fixed annuities and immediate fixed annuities have been adversely affected by the historically low interest rate environment. The company's immediate annuity business has also been affected by medical advancements that have resulted in annuitants living longer than anticipated when many of these contracts were signed. Given the declining returns, the company exited the sale of annuities over an eight year period from 2006-2014. In 2006, it disposed the variable annuity business through reinsurance agreements. Allstate remains focused on shifting its business mix by reducing the level of capital allocated to its more capital-intensive business lines. Other insurers have also reduced their exposure to fixed annuity business by either selling them completely or entering into reinsurance transaction. Last month, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. AMP entered into an agreement with Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group, to reinsure approximately $1.7 billion of fixed annuity policies, which is approximately 20% of the company's in force fixed annuity account balance. Last year, another insurer Voya Financial, Inc. VOYA got its $19 billion of fixed and fixed indexed annuity liabilities through Athene Holding Ltd. (ATH). This deal, if closed, will be a net positive for Allstate, allowing the company to utilize the capital for higher return generating business. The company is focused on growing its Personal Property-Liability market share and Protection businesses. Year to date, the stock has gained a good 16.3% compared with the industry 's growth of 1.8%.

Optimism Around U.S. - China Trade Talks Boost Markets Per a Wall Street Journal report, President Donald Trump was expected to announce an upcoming summit with China's president Xi Jinping. On Thursday, Trump met Chinese vice premier Liu He at his Oval Office in the White House. Further, in a tweet on the morning of Apr 4, Trump stated that trade talks with China were ""moving along nicely."" However, Trump also stated the United States and China were ""weeks away"" from signing a deal. Some of the major differences like enforcement mechanisms remained sticking points. However, positive developments on the trade war front boosted gains for the broader markets. Economic Data On the economic data front, number of jobless claims filed by citizens dropped to near 50-year low last week.

329," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The stock market has made a sharp recovery off its December lows. The nasty sentiment that ruled Wall Street last year has flipped on its head and the indices are back near all-time highs. Even the iShares Transportation Average ETF (BATS:
IYT
) is within 8% of its all-time highs. Yet, American Airlines (NASDAQ:
AAL
) stock is over 40% below its peak.  Despite the fact that airline businesses are now healthier than ever, AAL stock is wallowing at the bottom end of its five-year range. It's concerning that even when AAL has the wind at its sails, the stock still lags on Wall Street. For a better perspective, American Airlines Stock is now 15% below where it was during the November 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Fundamentally the business is healthy. AAL has pricing power and it gives almost no more frills. Passengers now even have to pay to reserve their seats. Moreover, oil, which is a major operating expense for airlines, is well off its highs. Yet for some reason, investors still don't trust AAL stock. As a result, American Airlines stock is cheap. It sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 11, which is in line with all its major competitors. So there is no froth in the stock. And these are lean valuations so the downside risk is by definition relatively small. This is not to say that it hasn't had its moments. AAL stock rose to $58 in January 2018. But since then it has been sliding into an abyss. And that's where the opportunity lies. There is hope on the horizon for AAL and the opportunity is based in technicals, so we don't have to rely on gaining the trust of traders. The fall from grace has been dramatic. For over a year, American Airlines stock has been trading inside a descending channel of lower highs and lower lows. But since late last year, it has formed a trough. The lows from the October, December and March corrections are at about the same levels. So it is forming a support zone. Moreover, this also coincides with the lows from 2016 and 2014. So it is safe to assume that AAL has fallen into a long-term pivot area. These tend to be support on the way down because both bulls and bears want to fight it out hard and this creates congestion in the price action. So the opportunity is that the bearish channel has transformed into a descending wedge which is coming into a pinch soon. It will set lower highs without setting lower lows, thereby creating tension that will result in a breakout to start a big bounce. The exact level that would trigger the rally is a moving target so it is best to be patient to get more clues. But it looks like if AAL closes above $36 per share it could invite momentum buyers. There will be resistance at $37.30 and near $41 per share, but the upside potential could be as high as $45 per share. Ideally one would wait for the trigger to initiate the trade but as cheap as AAL stock is now, I can't blame anyone who wants to jump the gun, especially if they intend to hold the stock for a long time. Earnings are coming soon, so the implied volatility will be high in AAL. I like the idea of selling puts now and then adding the shares after the breakout happens. This way, if AAL falls on the headline, I would have a nice buffer before suffering losses. The bottom line is that American Airlines stock has a technical opportunity coming that could carry it to ignite a big rally. This would come regardless of the lack of love on Wall Street.

331," Many investors love buying shares of highly profitable dividend-paying stocks with histories of giving their shareholders regular dividend increases over time. Such stocks don't tend to attract those looking to get rich quickly, but they can be very attractive to those who have already built substantial wealth or for those willing to build wealth over an extended period of time, using the power of compounding to their advantage. If you're interested in such stocks, here are three companies that pay significan t dividends today, have histories of consistent dividend increases, and whose businesses should support continued dividend growth for the foreseeable future: McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) , Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) , and PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) .  Image source: Getty Images. Everyone knows McDonald's. The chain is not only one of the most successful fast-food companies on the planet but also one of the most successful companies, period. The company's success can be measured in free cash flow -- and a lot of it. Over the last 12 months, McDonald's raked in $4.23 billion in free cash flow , translating into $5.38 in free cash flow per share. The fast-food giant is very generous about distributing the wealth to its shareholders, dishing out a quarterly dividend of $1.16, or $4.64 per share on an annual basis. That translates into a dividend yield of 2.44% based on the share price as of writing. Another thing to consider is that McDonald's has a long track record of raising its dividend, with the company proudly pointing out on its investor relations website that it has ""raised its dividend each and every year since paying its first dividend in 1976."" McDonald's isn't the sexiest stock, but it's a business that I think will be around -- and hugely successful -- for decades to come, something that'll allow it to not only keep paying a dividend but to keep its dividend increase streak alive. One company that you've surely heard of -- and one that's a favorite of esteemed investor Warren Buffett -- is Coca-Cola. While you might know Coca-Cola for, well, its Coca-Cola product, the company also sells a whole host of other products under other brand names. Minute Maid, Honest Tea, Fanta, Sprite, and Dasani are just some of its other offerings. Whether you're a fan of its products or not, Coca-Cola is a veritable cash cow, generating $6.28 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months, which translates into $1.46 per share. The company allocates a large portion of that free cash flow to its quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share ($1.20 per share on an annual basis). Coca-Cola is a longtime dividend payer, with a 55-year track record of consecutive dividend increases. What this means is that through good times and through bad, the company has not only been able to pay its shareholders, but it has been able to increase the amount that it paid them. With an amazing track record and an attractive 3.41% dividend yield, Coca-Cola certainly belongs on the short list of any income-oriented investor. Another great business is a key rival to the Coca-Cola Company -- PepsiCo. PepsiCo is another leading beverage maker that owns a number of top brands such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Aquafina, and Lipton Tea. What's interesting about PepsiCo, though, is that it's not just a beverage company -- it also owns many of the top snack brands, such as Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, and Fritos. PepsiCo, like the other stocks mentioned, throws off an incredible amount of free cash flow -- $6.13 billion, or nearly $4.31 per share over the last 12 months. The company's current quarterly dividend payment is $0.927 per share ($3.708 per share on an annualized basis), meaning that the company is giving back about 86% of its free cash flow to shareholders. Like both McDonald's and Coca-Cola, PepsiCo has an extremely long track record of both dividend payments and increases, with the company noting in its dividend announcement in February that it has ""paid consecutive quarterly cash dividends since 1965, and 2018 marked the company's 46th consecutive annual dividend increase."" PepsiCo is another solid stock that income-oriented investors should take a close look at.  10 stocks we like better than Coca-Cola

332," Shares of Orion Engineered Carbons (NYSE: OEC) plummeted 32.1% in March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence . The maker of Carbon Black -- a commercial form of solid carbon used by several industries -- sold off after the company reported its fourth-quarter results . On the one hand, Orion Engineered Carbons reported solid numbers for the fourth quarter. Revenue came in at $386 million, which was up 13.6% year over year and beat analysts' expectations by more than $12 million. Adjusted earnings, meanwhile, were $0.48 per share, which came in $0.01 per share ahead of the consensus estimate.  Image source: Getty Images. However, its underlying results weren't quite as good since volumes declined 6.1% due to a plant closure and reduced exports to China. Furthermore, the company offered a lackluster outlook for 2019, and anticipates that its adjusted EBITDA will be between $280 million to $300 million this year, which at the midpoint is 1.5% below last year's total. It also noted that it needs robust rubber demand and an acceleration in its specialty business in China to fuel a high-end finish. Orion Engineered Carbons is under pressure from weak market conditions, especially in China. That's due in part to its current trade dispute with the U.S. While the two countries are reportedly close to solving their differences, talks could fall apart. If that happens, Orion's shares could remain under pressure until the Chinese economy bounces back, which would likely take even more time.  10 stocks we like better than Orion Engineered Carbons

333," Swiss pharma giant Novartis AG NVS announced it is suing partner Amgen AMGN . Both the companies had a development and worldwide commercialization agreement for migraine drug, Aimovig (erenumab). Aimovig is designed specifically to block the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CRGP). Per Novartis, Aimovig is the first FDA and EMA-approved CGRP-targeted therapy for the prevention of migraine in adults. The drug was approved in the United States in May and EU in July 2018. Both the companies co-commercialize the drug in the United States. While Amgen has exclusive rights to commercialize the drug in Japan, Novartis has exclusive commercialization rights in the rest of the world. However, on Apr 2, 2019, Amgen issued a notice of termination for the migraine collaboration agreements with Novartis due to an alleged material breach of the same. Consequently, Novartis has filed a lawsuit asking the court to confirm that Amgen has no right to terminate the agreements. CRGP are a new class of drugs, which are designed to reduce the number of migraine attacks and have fewer adverse reactions in clinical trials, and lesser warnings and precautions compared to other approved migraine therapeutics. Other drugs in this category are Teva's TEVA Ajovy and Eli Lilly's LLY Emgality. The uptake of the drug has been encouraging, and more than 165,000 patients worldwide have been treated with Aimovig since launch. Shares of the company have gained 12.7% in the past six months compared with the industry 's 2.7% growth.   Last year was a transformative one for Novartis, as it restructured its business to become a core drug-focused company, powered by data and digital technologies. The company acquired U.S.-based clinical-stage gene-therapy company, AveXis, Inc in 2018. Novartis also acquired Endocyte to expand expertise in radiopharmaceuticals.

334," By Steve Holland and Trevor Hunnicutt WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday the U.S. Federal Reserve should lower interest rates and take other unconventional measures to ease pressure on an economy that he said they slowed down. ""I think they should drop rates,"" Trump told reporters. ""I think they really slowed us down. There's no inflation."" ""It should actually now be quantitative easing,"" Trump said. Trump's repeated public attacks on Fed policy and his intention to nominate two political allies to the central bank's board of governors has led some analysts to see the economic policymaker's cherished independence as under attack. The White House has said it does not wish to undermine the central bank's independence. The renewal of quantitative easing, Trump said, should be in addition to interest rate cuts - a likely worrying thought, at this point, for Fed officials who describe such a combination of tactics as only appropriate in a dire downturn. On Thursday, Trump said he plans to nominate his political ally Herman Cain, the former head of Godfather's Pizza, to one of two vacancies on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors. Cain runs a political fundraising group that has spent more than half its money supporting Trump's reelection. Two weeks ago, Trump said he would nominate conservative economic commentator Stephen Moore to the other vacant seat on the Fed's board. Moore is also a longtime Trump ally who has joined him in criticizing last year's rate hikes. The president's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told Bloomberg News that both potential nominees share the view that strong growth does not necessarily cause inflation, which central bankers try to prevent by raising rates. Half a dozen Fed officials in recent days have touted the underlying strength of the American economy and argued a recent spate of weak data on business activity is more likely to prove fleeting than lasting. None said they currently back a rate cut and some have said rate hikes may eventually be necessary. But a Fed chaired by a Trump appointee, Jerome Powell, has stopped raising rates after four hikes last year, saying that there are enough economic risks, including a slowdown in Europe and China, to warrant patience. The Fed's policy rate is currently between 2.25 and 2.5 percent. ",24.17999999999938,1

336," Lockheed Martin Corp.' s LMT business unit, Space Systems, recently clinched a modification contract to offer engineering and technical support services, and deliverable materials for the Trident II Fleet Ballistic Missile System. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Jun 30, 2021. Valued at $18 million, the contract was awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. Majority of the procurement will be executed in Cape Canaveral, FL, and Sunnyvale, CA. The contract will cater to the government of the United Kingdom. Per the terms of the deal, Space Systems will also support technical planning, direction, coordination and control to ensure that UK Fleet Ballistic Missile Program requirements are identified and integrated.
Trident II Specifics Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles (SLBMs), equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV) and thermonuclear warheads. Since its design completion in 1989, Trident II has made 167 successful test launches - a record unmatched by any other large ballistic missile or space launch vehicle. Our View Of late, increasing geopolitical conflicts, war, and terrorism across the globe have forced developing nations, the United States and other developed countries to significantly boost their missile strength. As a result, the United States - the largest provider of missile defense systems - is witnessing increased number of contracts from its government as well as allies for supplying combat proven missiles. SLBM is an integral part of the United States' strategic nuclear deterrent Triad, while Trident II D5 is one of the major SLBM programs in the nation. This surely positions Lockheed Martin, which is Trident's primary contractor, in a comparatively advantageous spot when it comes to the U.S. Navy's preferred missile programs. These factors might have helped Lockheed Martin to win the latest contract. Looking Ahead The global rocket and missile market, which also includes fleet ballistic missiles, is projected to witness a CAGR of 4.74% during the 2017-2022 period to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Such projects reflect increased growth opportunities for missile-makers like Lockheed Martin in the aforementioned market, moving ahead. Moreover, in March 2019, Trump proposed fiscal 2020 defense budget worth $750 billion, which reflects a solid 5% increase from last fiscal's spending. On approval, such budgetary developments should have a favorable impact on Lockheed Martin's financials. Price Movement In a year's time, shares of Lockheed Martin have lost 11.2% compared with the industry 's 1.5% decline.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks Lockheed Martin currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Spirit Aerosystems Holdings SPR , Heico Corporation HEI and AeroVironment, Inc. AVAV .

Morris Goldfarb, the company's Chairman and CEO, pointed to G-III's five ""power brands"" that drove its record profits: DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Karl Lagerfeld. ""This was also a transformative year for us as it was the first full year in which products for DKNY and Donna Karan were created and developed by us,"" he continued. ""In this ever-changing retail landscape, our consistent execution positions us to be a global provider of fashion product. With the current power brands we have today, we believe we can continue to achieve significant organic growth opportunities over the next several years."" Year-to-date, shares of GIII are up 50% compared to the S&P 500's gain of almost 16%. Along with strong Q4 results, G-III provided strong guidance for fiscal 2020. The company expects EPS between $3.18 and $3.28 per share, with revenues of $3.3 billion. And for the current quarter, G-III should repor t earnings of 13 cents to 23 cents per share on revenues of roughly $650 million. Estimates, thus, have been rising lately too, pushing the stock towards a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). For the current fiscal year, the company's earnings are expected to grow about 15.4% year-over-year. Five analysts have revised their estimates upwards in the past 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved sixteen cents higher from $3.14 to $3.30 during the same time frame (which sits above the company's current guided range). 2021 looks pretty strong too, and earnings are expected to grow almost 11%; next year's consensus estimate sits at $3.66 per share, with two upward revisions in the last 60 days. If you're an investor looking for an apparel stock to add to your portfolio, make sure to keep GIII on your shortlist. Bear of the Day : Headquartered in Newark, California, SMART Global Holdings designs, manufactures, and supplies electronic subsystems to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and engages primarily in the computer, industrial, networking, telecommunications, and aerospace and defense markets. SMART Global operates throughout the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Disappointing Q2 Earnings While earnings of 77 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents, EPS declined considerably from the year-ago quarter; Q2 2018 earnings were $1.64 per share. Revenues of $304 million missed our consensus estimate and declined 3.2% year-over-year due to weakness in the company's Brazil business. Net sales in SMART Global's Brazil segment fell 29.5% year-over-year to $147.1 million on a ""worsening price environment"" for smartphone and PC commodity memory products. However, SGH's specialty memory segment saw sales increase nearly 10% from the year-ago quarter to $115.6%. And to its acquisition of Penguin Computing last summer, the company's specialty compute and storage solutions segment posted sales of $41.3 million. On top of these weak results was a weak outlook for SGH's third quarter. SMART Global expects net sales between $260 million and $270 million and adjusted earnings in the range of 34 cents and 38 cents per share. Analysts were projected EPS of 90 cents per share on revenues near $332 million. Analysts have since turned bearish on SMART Global, with four cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year. Earnings are expected to decline 43% for the year, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped over one dollar during that same time period from $4.63 to $3.61 per share. This sentiment has stretched into 2020, though the shifting tide hasn't been as dramatic. Earnings could see growth of around 6%, but our consensus estimate has dropped significantly in the past two months. SGH is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Shares of the specialty memory leader have fallen almost 27% since January. In comparison, the S&P 500 is up almost 16% year-to-date. 3 Defense Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio Now U.S. defense stocks have been riding high ever since President Trump entered the Oval Office. Impressively, the Zacks Aerospace sector, which includes the U.S. defense biggies, has gained 18.1% in 2019 so far compared with the S&P 500's increase of 14.3%. Let us now discuss in brief the growth catalysts that will continue to drive U.S. defense stocks' rally as the year progresses. A Solid Budget for Fiscal 2020 Trump proposed defense spending of $750 billion last month for fiscal 2020. This new plan reflects a solid 5% increase from the nation's existing defense budget.  No doubt, on approval, this budget would significantly boost the profit of U.S. defense biggies. Notably, the proposed budget provisions $165 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) (as reported by CNN), an account that pays for military operations overseas in places like Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. If approved, this would mark a striking increase from the 2019 budget, which sought $69 billion for that operational account. As major U.S. defense companies continue to expand their international presence, such a significant increase in OCO provision will certainly boost their businesses across the globe. Prospective Mergers Last year, the U.S. defense space witnessed a number of notable mergers and acquisitions like that of Northrop with Orbital ATK and United Technologies with Rockwell Collins. This is because companies are trying to enhance their portfolio to reap the benefits of expanding defense budget and survive amid cutthroat competition. Keeping up with this trend, L3 Technologies is all set to merge with Harris Corp. Such mergers should further strengthen the U.S. defense space, attracting more contracts from across the world. Solid Q1 Earnings Picture As of Apr 3, companies in the Zacks Aerospace sector are expected to record annual earnings growth of 4.5% on sales growth of 8.6% in Q1. Such encouraging quarterly estimates set the stage for the addition of defense stocks to one's portfolio. Our Choices President Trump's huge defense spending proposal and ever-growing geopolitical tensions and America's defense resolve should lead to gains for defense stocks in 2019. In this context, we have selected four defense stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have outperformed the S&P 500.

It is worth considering Triton International (TRTN), which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry. This shipping container leasing company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7.06%. For the las t report ed quarter, Triton came out with earnings of $1.25 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share, representing a surprise of 9.65%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to pos t earnings of $1.12 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.17 per share, delivering a surprise of 4.46%. Price and EPS Surprise  Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Triton lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.

Triton currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.87%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

347," Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its nex t quarterly report ? TransCanada (TRP), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry, could be a great candidate to consider. This energy infrastructure company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 20.12%. For the las t report ed quarter, TransCanada came out with earnings of $0.78 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.70 per share, representing a surprise of 11.43%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to pos t earnings of $0.59 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.76 per share, delivering a surprise of 28.81%. Price and EPS Surprise  With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for TransCanada. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. TransCanada currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.53%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate. Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

352," Macquarie Infrastructure Company MIC recently entered into definitive agreements to divest each of its portfolios of solar and wind power generation businesses. The company anticipates generating total gross proceeds of $215 million from these transactions. Per one of the agreements, Macquarie will sell its 203MW (gross) portfolio of wind generation assets to DIF Infrastructure V - a fund of DIF. The other agreement will involve the company to divest its 142 MW portfolio of solar power generation facilities to Goldman Sachs Renewable Power LLC. Notably, both deals are subject to regulatory clearance and projected to close in stages through 2019. Notably, the move is in sync with the company's portfolio-restructuring program, which involves its goal of exiting its renewable power generation businesses. As a matter of fact, the proceeds from these divestments will help Macquarie to finance part of its growth investment in other businesses. Greentech Capital Advisors served as Macquarie's financial advisor while Winston & Strawn LLP was its legal advisor. Our Take Macquarie is well poised to gain from healthy growth opportunities in Atlantic Aviation and MIC Hawaii segments in the quarters ahead. MIC Hawaii segment's revenues in the upcoming quarters will likely gain momentum on the back of implementation of new gas rates. Also, investments planned, primarily for the International-Matex Tank Terminals (""IMTT"") segment, will be beneficial. Further, the company's growth investments are likely to strengthen performance of its segments. For 2019, growth capital expenditure is likely to be $275-$300 million, with a major chunk likely to be used for the IMTT segment. In addition, the company's healthy cash flow allows management to return higher value to shareholders. In 2018, it distributed dividends totaling $378.4 million. Macquarie currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Over the past year, the company has returned 9.1%, outperforming the industry 's growth of 3.7%.  Other Key Picks Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space are Carlisle Companies Incorporated CSL , Federal Signal Corporation FSS and United Technologies Corporation UTX . While Carlisle sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Federal Signal and United Technologies carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

353,"A company's own top management tend to have the best inside view into the business, so when company officers make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $982.1K by Ornella Barra, Co-Chief Operating Officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (Symbol: WBA).

354," There is nothing new about a President, or any politician for that matter, banging heads with the Fed. The independence of the central bank and its long-term mission to foster stability makes that inevitable. Politicians tend not to look beyond their immediate needs, whereas economic progress is best measured in decades rather than months. It's for that reason that we should not overreact to Donald Trump’s criticism of his own pick for Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, even though this does feel different from criticisms in the past. The difference is essentially one of style. Whatever you think of Trump, his thinking is always clear to see. His propensity to tweet whatever is on his mind at any given time gives us a unique insight into his priorities, and right now it is clear that he is unhappy with the Fed tapping the brakes as growth accelerated. Other Presidents, when unhappy with Fed policy, have grumbled in private and, in extreme circumstances, offered veiled criticisms couched in an acknowledgement of the importance of independence. This President is just a lot more forthright. There is, however, one way in which politicians influence the central bank. The Board of Governors that runs the Fed, as well as the Fed Chair, are appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate. As I said, the President’s open dissatisfaction with monetary policy is not something to get worked up about. It is unsettling to some, but essentially changes nothing. Donald Trump’s latest reported candidate for appointment, Herman Cain, is different. Cain’s politics are not the point. What should be worrying for all investors are his views on economics, and on monetary policy in particular. Cain has, on several occasions in the past, voiced support for a return to the gold standard, and that would be a step backwards. It could strangle growth in America and put the country at an enormous disadvantage when compared to other countries. Tying currencies to gold gives an enormous advantage to those that produce most of the metal. They can keep their production as reserves, allowing them to expand their money supply and therefore their economic capacity. As you can see from this list, that would give both China and Russia an advantage over the U.S. It is no accident that the greatest period of economic expansion in history has followed the abandonment of the gold standard. Nor is it any accident that the decision to fully abandon the gold standard was taken by a Republican, Richard Nixon. A free-floating currency means that that currency’s value is decided by a free market, an imperfect system for sure, but one that has proven over time to be the most equitable and efficient yet devised. What is surprising is that opposition to that system is now found in the Republican Party, Cain being a case in point. Opposition to the current system isn't exclusive to the right, obviously. There are those on the far left who believe that monetary policy should be set by Congress rather than by an independent central bank. It doesn’t take a lot of imagination or an in-depth knowledge of economics to see how that could be disastrous. The aforementioned short-term outlook of politicians would make for a strong temptation to just print money to finance pet projects and garner popularity. The effects of that have been seen throughout history, from Germany’s Weimar Republic to modern-day Venezuela. There is nothing wrong with challenging orthodoxy, that is how progress is made in all walks of life. Sometimes, though, you have to look objectively at what the status quo has achieved. From that perspective, an independent Fed and a free-floating dollar, not one tied artificially to a commodity, has been enormously successful and increased the overall wealth of not just this nation, but the world. To abandon that, or even to hint at doing so by appointing someone like Cain to the Fed’s board, just because the current President is upset with Powell, would be folly in the extreme.",24.17999999999938,1

356," Americans filing for unemployment benefits declined for the third week in a row at March 2019 end. The latest U.S. Labor Department data revealed that seasonally adjusted initial claims for the week ended Mar 30 declined 10,000 from prior week's revised level to 202,000. This is the lowest figure for initial claims since Dec 6, 1969. It also came below the consensus estimate of 217,000 and Reuters' estimate of 216,000. The four-week moving average, which is considered a better measure of labor market trends as it evens out the sharp fluctuations in weekly reports, declined 4,000 from the previous week's revised average to 213,500 (the lowest level since Oct 6, 2018). This was the 208th straight week in which filings stayed below the 300,000 threshold, the longest streak since 1970. Declining claims reflects the fact that the labor market continues to remain strong despite a slowdown in economic growth. Labor Market Continues to Remain in Good Shape The economy continues to create new jobs despite a record low jobless rate. Per a Reuters report , nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase by 180,000 jobs in March 2019 after a modest addition of 20,000 jobs in February (marking a slowdown from robust job additions in the previous two months). The unemployment rate is anticipated to remain unchanged at 3.8%. Another report from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas claims that planned job cuts by U.S.-based employers reduced 21% to 60,587 in March 2019. ""We see the initial claims data as consistent with healthy labor market conditions and in line with the widely anticipated rebound in the pace of payroll employment in March,"" stated Jonathan Millar, an economist at Barclays in New York. Given this encouraging backdrop, we are looking forward to the March employmen t report , which is scheduled to be released today. Manufacturing and Non-manufacturing Solid The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) measured by Institute of Supply Management (ISM) touched 55.3% in March, indicating better economic activity in the manufacturing sector. This marks the 31 st consecutive month of manufacturing growth. Also, March was the 110th straight month of growth in non-manufacturing activities, with ISM-measured Non-Manufacturing Index (NMI) touching 56.1%. Thriving manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities backed by Trump's favorable policies keep the staffing industry healthy. Momentum to Continue Through 2019 The staffing industry has been growing roughly two times faster than the economy, on average, since the end of the Great Recession.A strong U.S. economy and Trump's business-friendly moves have been benefiting manufacturing as well as non-manufacturing sectors, which, in turn, aided the staffing industry in 2018. The aforementioned factors are expected to benefit the industry in 2019 as well. Per a recent report by talentnow, the U.S. staffing market is expected to grow from $147 billion in 2018 to $152 billion in 2019.  Global staffing revenues are expected to register 6% growth in 2019 compared with 7% growth in 2018. The unemployment rate is expected to be 3.7% in 2019, the lowest in 49 years. 4 Staffing Stocks From a Healthy Labor Market With indications that the staffing industry will continue to grow through 2019, investors are expected to continue focusing on staffing stocks.

359," It's not easy to pick winning stocks, but as The Motley Fool's various services prove year in and year out, it's certainly not impossible. With the right mind-set and some careful research, an individual investor with a long-term, buy-and-hold mentality can craft a portfolio that will outperform the market. But just how many stocks should be in such a portfolio? One guideline that we devised is the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum, which is simply the ratio of the number of stocks in your portfolio to your age. For example, if you own shares of 30 different companies, and you're 24, your score on the G-K C is 30/24= 1.25. We think a good level to shoot for is a number above 1. But that's not the only way to go. In this mailbag segment from the Rule Breaker Investing podcast, a listener is looking for insights about the upsides of greater diversification, and alternately, the positives of holding somewhat fewer companies. Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner and Head of Motley Fool Asia David Kretzmann reflect on the pros and cons of various approaches.

The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.  This video was recorded on March 27, 2019. David Gardner: Now, to the question at hand, David Kretzmann. Paul writes, ""I had a question about the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum. I'm 38 years old with a G-K C score of around 0.7. If anything, I would like to make it lower. I had read in the past that individual investors tend to perform best when they stick with their highest-conviction ideas. Expanding beyond that tends to dilute performance. That makes sense to me, and it's why I've always tried to stick to between 20-30 companies. That also seems to go with the Rule Breaker philosophy to me. Why would I want to invest in my 31st best idea when I could just add more to my two or three best ideas? Can you tell me where I might be wrong, why more positions are better? Thanks again for all that you do. Fool on, Paul."" David Kretzmann: Awesome question! I think it's something that we repeat a lot of times on this podcast and other podcasts: your mileage will vary depending on your own situation, your own preferences, risk tolerance. There's not necessarily anything wrong with having a G-K C score below 1, which Paul in this case has. I think most individual investors should shoot for a G-K C score of about 1, just to be thinking in terms of broad diversification within your individual portfolio. Gardner: Let me pause you right there, David, because I know we have some new listeners since we last talked about the G-K C, which we seem to do every month or two on this podcast. Could you briefly define our term, the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum? What does 0.7 mean? Kretzmann: Sure. The Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum, it's probably lapping its one-year anniversary at this point, if I'm not mistaken. Gardner: I've heard rumors that it's being considered for the Nobel Prize in Economics. Kretzmann: Oh, excellent! Gardner: It puts Gardner and Kretzmann in a position -- I'm not going to say a pole position, but potentially, to win the big bling, that hunk of metal that I always imagine the Nobel Prize must be. Obviously, modesty can sometimes escape us. David, what is the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum? Kretzmann: This is a simple score. You take the number of stocks that you own in your portfolio and you divide it by your age. As an example, let's say you own 50 stocks and you're 25 years old. Your G-K C score is calculated by dividing the number of stocks that you own -- in this example, 50 stocks -- divided by your age -- 25 years old. So in this case, your G-K C score would be 2. Gardner: Well above one. That's remarkable! You have a lot of stocks, given your age. Kretzmann: A lot of diversification for your age. If you're 50 years old and own 50 stocks, your G-K C score is 1. Generally on this podcast, over the past year or so, as our G-K C score has evolved, David, you and I have thought that you don't need to aim for just 1. But ideally, 1 or higher. Gardner: 1.0 is kind of the golden mean. A way of thinking about it is, if you're 25 years old, maybe you should have 25 stocks. I'm 52, I have about 52 stocks. There's no one way to go here. That's why it's called the Gardner-Kretzmann ""Continuum."" Kretzmann: Some people will be below 1 and they'll be perfectly comfortable with that. Gardner: Like Paul! Kretzmann: To Paul's point, the question of, is it OK to shoot for 20 to 25 stocks, there's the Warren Buffett adage or quote that's out there, he says you should really treat buying stocks like you're punching a card where you only have 20 boxes to punch or check. Essentially meaning that over the course of your life, invest as if you're only going to buy 20 companies. I think the meaning behind that quote is to really focus on buying quality, great businesses that you want to own for a lifetime, which is something we aspire to do as Fools. On the flip side, in our recommendation services like Stock Advisor or Rule Breakers -- or really, since The Motley Fool launched with you and Tom over 25 years ago -- the focus has really been to continue following and recommending stocks week by week, month by month, really trying to continually explore the world of business out there and try to find all the quality businesses out there. I think now in Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers , we've probably recommended over 300 companies over the past two decades or so. Gardner: Many of which remain active recommendations. But yeah. In my experience, David, now in our third decade of The Motley Fool, and having been there at the very start, having met so many individual investors of all stripes in many different countries -- David, you're now head of Motley Fool Asia, so you especially know that better than I -- in my experience anyway, the mistake most people make is they are not diversified enough. They do not have enough stocks. So it makes me far happier to see somebody with a lot of stocks than with just a few stocks. Paul, I think 0.7 is just fine. You sound like a savvier guy at the age of 38. You've got less than 38 stocks. If that's working for you, that's great. If you want to keep adding your winners, we like that too. Kretzmann: Yeah, absolutely! This is all directional more than anything, trying to think in terms of more diversification, not less, especially for beginners. I think a common mistake is to only buy one or two or three stocks. That way, you're just so emotionally invested in those companies. You're more likely to follow short-term movements in that case and potentially get spooked out of the market or just get the wrong idea that, ""Hey, one of my stocks jumped 30% this month! I'm really good at this! I'll just keep doing this! Rinse and repeat."" I think one of the benefits also of owning more stocks is, it encourages you to pay attention to the world maybe a little bit more closely. Your portfolio doesn't get stagnant. Even if the new stocks you're adding represent less than 1% of your portfolio, you have a little bit of skin in the game. You can follow along. Especially with the year like this. You have a lot of new companies coming public. You have Lyft , Zoom, Uber, a bunch of different companies -- Gardner: Pinterest. Kretzmann: -- Airbnb, hitting the public markets. Having skin in the game, I think, encourages you to follow along like an owner. And it can make it a little bit more fun. Gardner: Absolutely! So, again, thank you, Paul, for a great question! There is no one-size-fits-all. That is why it's the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum. We of course have fun with that, but we're deadly serious about the point. Each of us should be maintaining a well-diversified portfolio. That phrase can mean different things for different people at different stages of their life.

360," While one of the major reasons people invest is to save for retirement, it's certainly not the only one. Life events such as buying a home, paying for your children's higher education, or purchasing investment property are likely to come up on your agenda long before your career comes to a close. And to swing those expenses, you may just need to divest yourself of some shares. In this mailbag segment from the Rule Breaker Investing podcast, listener Jeff Pew is looking for some reassurance that he's taking the right approach. Should he be selling portions of his top stock positions to finance property purchase and the like? Of course, says Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner -- and for some younger-generation perspective, he's asked analyst Emily Flippen to chime in, too. And she has some important points to make on the subject of timing those stock sales. A full transcript follows the video.   10 stocks we like better than Walmart
When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of January 31, 2019
The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.  This video was recorded on March 27, 2019. David Gardner: Mailbag item No. 5. Speaking of 'what a world,' love this one! Is this my favorite mailbag item of the month? Close. Maybe. Really close. Awesome! ""Hi, my name is Jeff Pew. I'm an actor in New York City currently performing in Frozen on Broadway. I've been a subscriber to Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers for a few years, and an avid listener to all of The Fool podcasts. Over the past year, I've been successful at converting two of my friends in the show to The Motley Fool way. We've enjoyed discussing stock picks, following The Fool's guidance, forming strategies on how to best position ourselves for the future. We are all currently beating the market thanks to you."" Well, Jeff Pew and friends, and really the whole cast of Frozen and frankly, all of Broadway, thank you! Awesome! Jeff goes on: ""Here's my question. Do you ever sell a position you've been holding for a long time to free up capital for a big purchase like a down payment on a house, down payment on a weekend house, investment property, renovation, new landscaping, college tuition, or helping a family member in a time of need? Ideally, we'd all have enough savings on top of our investments to pay for these types of big purchases. But what if we don't? Is it OK to be holding some of our biggest positions with the intention to sell when we have enough money to achieve a goal we've been working toward for a long time? When do we use the money we've been earning? ""I love The Motley Fool. I've been listening to you and your colleagues long enough now that I almost feel like I know you. Thanks for the fantastic advice and education. Sincerely, Jeff Pew."" Now, Emily, I know that we're of different generations, we've established this. You are younger than I am, I would say by about a generation. I have kids that are about your age. In fact, you were once a summer intern at The Motley Fool, and I believe at least one of my kids was that same summer. We probably each have different perspectives, which is why I wanted to have you on. I'm assuming you haven't had a lot of big lump-sum kinds of payments or needs for your investing portfolio thus far? Emily Flippen: No. Have not been buying myself vacation homes just yet. Gardner: Yes, I appreciate that. But do you have any take on this? Your thinking as an investor, in terms of, if you have larger positions, should you be actively thinking about harvesting them near the time that you might want to buy that house, or not? Flippen: It's twofold. In general, I think it's fine to cut back on your larger positions or your portfolio as a whole if you need that money to make a planned purchase. That's what that money, for many people, is there for. The flip side of that is, you really shouldn't be doing it right before you need to buy a house, for instance. If you're planning to buy a house in three years, and you have all of that money invested and a lot of it into a handful of stocks, if the market goes down -- Gardner: Like fourth quarter of 2018, for example? A lot of our stocks lost a third of their value, even though a lot of them are back. Flippen: Exactly. So it's important not to be withdrawing your money when the market could be going through a downtime. You should ideally plan to slowly transition that money out from whatever stocks, whatever holdings you choose, into a safer vehicle for when you need that money in the future. Gardner: Thank you! Very well put! And I'll just add, Jeff, that yeah, in a lot of ways, this is why we invest. It's not just a game -- well, it is a game, it's fun, and you should try to win. But this is a game that has real-world consequences. Often, the reason that we invest is to do the things that you talked about. For me in my own life, I bought a house. I've done that a few times. I usually have sold off stock in order to buy that house. That's why I was investing. Really, looking backward, it was some of my arguably worst financial decisions, because some of the stocks that I sold have done far better than almost any piece of real estate could. So, sometimes you're paying an opportunity cost for transitioning money that was in great stocks into a house that probably won't grow at the same rate as Netflix . Regardless, this is why we invest. I don't think anybody should be shy about selling a large position in order to fund any one of those key life goals that you articulated. But as Emily said, I do want to echo that as I approached buying that house, I knew it was going to be a house I was going to be buying in the next year or two, so I began to sell down positions. If it is going to be selling stock, you start doing it in advance so that you don't set yourself up for a really bad surprise last second, as you hoped to fund something big and the market cowed.

361," Fitbit FIT recently rolled out Bitmoji clock feature in select smartwatches in collaboration with Snap, Inc. SNAP with an aim to make fitness more fun and motivating.  Fitbit, Inc. Revenue (TTM)   Fitbit, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Fitbit, Inc. Quote Market Prospects Abound

The fitness tracker space is currently experiencing growing proliferation of wearables globally, due to comfort and ease that these products provide in tracking fitness. Notably, Fitbit sold a whopping 5.6 million wearable devices in the fourth quarter of 2018, increasing 3% year over year.

We believe Fitbit's enhanced wearable offerings will help it to strengthen foothold in the global smartwatch market, which per Allied Market Research data, is likely to witness a CAGR of 16.2% between 2018 and 2025, and is anticipated to hit $31.1 billion by 2025.

Wrapping Up

The Fitbit-Snap partnership is a win-win situation for both the companies. Unlike other wearable players, Fitbit moved beyond healthcare alliances to add a bit of social media driven emoji color to its smartwatch, which is commendable.

Meanwhile, Snap is striving to expand the reach of Bitmoji by adding new capabilities to its Snap Kit platform and forming robust collaborations. In fact, PayPal owned mobile payment service, Venmo, is also expected to get Bitmoji support.

Currently, Fitbit carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .

With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores , helps address this issue for us. Below, we take a look at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions. It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Chipotle Mexican Grill currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>> Set to Beat the Market? In order to see if CMG is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this Mexican food chain holds up. Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area. For CMG, shares are up 5.79% over the past week while the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry is up 1.64% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 15.4% compares favorably with the industry's 1.57% performance as well. While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill have increased 38.02% over the past quarter, and have gained 114.64% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 14.25% and 11.02%, respectively. Investors should also pay attention to CMG's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CMG is currently averaging 615,205 shares for the last 20 days. Earnings Outlook The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CMG. Over the past two months, 13 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CMG's consensus estimate, increasing from $12.13 to $12.36 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period. Bottom Line Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CMG is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B.

Shares of Charles River Laboratories have increased 20.32% over the past quarter, and have gained 36.45% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 14.25% and 11.02%, respectively. Investors should also pay attention to CRL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CRL is currently averaging 343,168 shares for the last 20 days. Earnings Outlook The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CRL. Over the past two months, 9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CRL's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.36 to $6.48 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period. Bottom Line Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CRL is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Charles River Laboratories on your short list.",24.17999999999938,1

369,"   Over the years, Bitcoin has gained a reputation for having a ""toxic"" community of users around it. This accusation is mostly thrown at Bitcoin by proponents of altcoins and those who have supported various Bitcoin hard fork attempts in the past. Of course, this is an oversimplification of the Bitcoin community. Crypto Twitter, which is the main hub of online cryptocurrency conversations these days, does not make up anywhere near the entire Bitcoin user base. When people talk about the Bitcoin community being toxic, they're mostly complaining that some Bitcoin users were mean to them on the internet. Having said that, there is a logical reason that some Bitcoin users get extremely angry at certain members of the greater crypto asset community. Bitcoin is defined by a set of protocol rules . It is these rules, which are effectively set in stone ( see: Satoshi ), that provide the underlying value proposition of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's most important feature is not necessarily its specific monetary policy (the 21 million cap) or any of the other specific rules. Instead, the fact that the rules are extremely difficult to change is the key selling point (I've written a longer explanation of this here ). Of course, people could decide to abandon Bitcoin and go use something else (an altcoin or some forked version of Bitcoin), but that would necessitate the creation of a new network. With this in mind, it should become clear why attempts to change the rules of Bitcoin through social attacks are met with disgust. Attempting to use social clout or ""thought leadership"" in an effort to push users over to a new network with different rules undermines the underlying value proposition of this technology.   If something new were to overtake Bitcoin through pressure from a consortium of influential nodes on the network, then what's to stop that from happening again with the new coin of the moment? Perhaps more importantly, will the new coin stick to the core ethos of Bitcoin as an apolitical store of value and medium of exchange ? If Bitcoin is susceptible to this sort of persuasion from influential players in the space, then it's unclear how different it is from the traditional financial system or non-cryptocurrencies like Ripple's XRP . Bitcoin proved resistant to this sort of persuasion in the case of the New York Agreement , in which a consortium of economically relevant Bitcoin nodes and miners effectively got together to say some new fork of Bitcoin with a larger block size limit ( which increases the cost of operating a full node ) was going to be the new, official version of Bitcoin. It's not a stretch to call the New York Agreement an attack on the whole point of Bitcoin existing in the first place. Various businesses built on top of Bitcoin were putting their own needs ahead of the viability of bitcoin as an apolitical money. Perhaps more importantly, they issued their plan as a decree rather than a proposal. Yes, those companies had users of their own to represent, but it's possible that the power of users focused on the store-of-value use case were ignored in favor of those who put greater emphasis on the use of bitcoin as a medium of exchange. On Twitter, some signers of the New York Agreement referred to those who shared criticisms associated with the 2x portion of SegWit2x as toxic individuals. At the time, I wrote about how the creation of a federated sidechain may be a more sensible approach to the need to free up block space on the base of the Bitcoin blockchain. But the SegWit2x train had already left the station. Thankfully, the failure of SegWit2x ended up being nothing more than an illustration of the difficulties associated with pulling off social attacks on Bitcoin. The whole ordeal added credibility to the ""digital gold"" meme that had long been associated with bitcoin. Bitcoin's current consensus rules are the Schelling point when people are unsure of what to do in the case of a network split, which makes it difficult for hard-forking changes to happen without widespread consensus. If there is going to be some kind of hard fork of the Bitcoin network, there better be a damned good reason to do so, such as a critical bug in consensus-related software. Otherwise, the ""toxic trolls"" are incentivized to respond to your attack on Bitcoin's apolitical nature. With all of this in mind, the question must be asked: Who is really the toxic part of the Bitcoin community? Those who attempted to push users to a new network and call it ""Bitcoin"" or those who said some mean words on the internet? This is not to say every signatory of the New York Agreement is toxic. Some, such as Xapo CEO and PayPal board member Wences Casares , may have simply made a mistake, while others, such as F2Pool's Chun Wang , may have never had any intention to run the code associated with the hard-forking portion of the agreement. Although the technical details of Bitcoin get a lot of attention, the system is mostly built on game theory. The ""toxic maximalism"" that is sometimes associated with Bitcoin has its roots in the structure of incentives originally put into place by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin users are effectively incentivized to attack anyone who attempts any sort of social attack on the system. When certain individuals or entities push for a noncompatible change to Bitcoin and the ""toxic maximalists"" respond in anger, it is human nature for those pushing for the incompatible changes to get stuck in their position and become unwilling to admit they were wrong to make the proposal in the first place. The original mistake was to advocate for breaking consensus without proper support , but that led to a series of other mistakes, which were avoidable. The block size wars were a valuable lesson for everybody, but they were an especially costly lesson for those who simply could not admit they had made a mistake and continued on their crusade via the Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) altcoin. At the end of the day, those who saw the error of their ways and didn't go down the path of Bitcoin Cash are better for it. After all, it's beneficial for everyone if we're all using the same money. The fact that you can transact with your worst enemies via the Bitcoin network is a big part of apolitical money. Note: This article was partially inspired by ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees's recent appearance on What Bitcoin Did and BTC Inc CEO David Bailey's recent appearance on the Stephan Livera Podcast . I recommend listening to both of those podcast episodes.",24.17999999999938,1

371," WASHINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he is considering an economic penalty apart from tariffs to counter the smuggling of drugs from Mexico across the southern U.S. border. Trump threatened on Thursday to put a 25 percent tariff on cars coming from Mexico into the United States if Mexico does not continue to help Washington deal with the immigration and drug situation along the border. He repeated that warning on Friday morning and added, ""Likewise I am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border."" It was not immediately clear what other penalties the U.S. president was considering. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for elaboration. Trump said the tariff decision related to drugs would supplant provisions of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as USMCA. ""If for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from, the U.S. will be forced to Tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us. If that doesn't work, which it will, I will close the Border,"" Trump said on Twitter on Friday. ""This will supersede USMCA."" ",24.17999999999938,1

In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52-week high mark.

373," The Western Union Co. WU has collaborated with Coins.ph, one of the Philippines' leading e-wallet providers. The pact will allow more than five million customers to receive money transfers directly into their Coins.ph wallets in the Philippines. Customers will be able to transfer money in more than 60 countries having Western Union's digital service and in more 200 countries and territories having its retail network. The integration of blockchain technology of Coins.ph and vast agent network of Western Union will provide good remittance services to customers. Coins.ph is a perfect partner for Western Union as the former has more than five million wallet holders in the Philippines, thus providing with a ready customer base. This deal will provide an attractive market for Western Union since an estimated 10 million Filipino workers reside overseas, creating huge demand for money transfer service. According to the World Bank's Migration and Remittances Brief, the Philippines is one of the top remittance receiving countries in the world. Western Union has been providing money transfer services in the Philippines since 1990 and has more than 12,000 Agent locations in the country. Another money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI) also provides its remittance services in the country. A day ago, Western Union announced its tie up with Dollar General Corporation DG , a chain of variety stores, which will enable money transfer at more than 15,400 locations throughout the 44 states in which Dollar General operates. Customers will be able to initiate international and domestic money transfers through the Western Union mobile app or by visiting westernunion.com.  The funds can then be paid in person at Dollar General locations. Consumers can also receive transferred amount at Dollar General stores. Since 75% of the American population lives within a five-mile radius of a Dollar General, this tie-up will provide a vast and ready customer base for Western Union. These tie ups and partnerships are in line with the company's efforts to grow its market share amid rising competition from many fintech companies that have entered the payments space in recent years. The company is also streamlining its operations and have entered into an agreement to sell off its SpeedPay business, the proceeds from which will be utilized to return capital to its shareholders and manage its capital structure. The company's revenues have been under pressure. High compliance costs and foreign exchange volatility have further taken a toll on its stock price which has declined 0.3% in a year's time against the industry 's growth of 24%.

377," Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 's HII unit, Newport News, has clinched a modification contract to support the USS Columbus (SSN 762) ship. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by August 2019. Details of the Deal Valued at $18.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair, Newport News, VI. Per the modification, Newport News will support maintenance, repair, fleet-funded alterations, testing and routine work related to the USS Columbus. The entire task will be performed in Newport News, VI. A Brief Note on the USS Columbus USS Columbus (SSN-762), the fourth ship of the Navy to be named after Columbus, OH, is a Los Angeles-class attack submarine. It is to be noted that on Mar 21, 1986, General Dynamics Corporation's (GD) Electric Boat division had received a contract to build the ship. Our View Huntington Ingalls is the prime industrial employer in Virginia. Through its Newport News segment, the company operates as the nation's sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Notably, over 70% of the active Navy fleet comprise Huntington Ingalls ships. The company's Ingalls Shipbuilding segment is the sole manufacturer of amphibious assault ships for the Navy. Also, we note that Huntington Ingalls is the only builder of National Security Cutters (NSCs) for the U.S. Coast Guard and one of only two companies that build the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. These attributes helped the company to win regular shipbuilding related orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is a bright instance of the same. We expect Huntington Ingalls to maintain this momentum, given the current U.S. administration's favoritism toward increasing defense spending. Notably, the shipbuilding business outlook remains strong, particularly in light of the U.S. Navy's latest shipbuilding plan that calls for building a 355-ship fleet. In sync with this, Congressional Budget Office expects average construction costs for the Navy's 2019 shipbuilding plan to be $28.9 billion per year over the next 30 years.  This amount is 80% more than what the Navy has spent, on average, over the past 30 years. Price Movement In a year's time, shares of Huntington Ingalls have plunged 18.6%, underperforming the industry 's 1.6% fall.   Zacks Rank Huntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

379," By Tom Miles GENEVA, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. security concerns about 5G mobile networks built by Chinese telecoms giant Huawei appear to be driven by politics and trade rather than any evidence, the head of the U.N. internet and telecoms agency said on Friday. Houlin Zhao, secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), told reporters in Geneva that security of 5G networks was in everybody's interest but so far he had not seen anything to substantiate claims about Huawei. The United States has urged its allies to ban Huawei from building 5G networks, saying it could be used for espionage. Huawei has rubbished the allegations, saying Washington had a ""loser's attitude"". ""I would encourage Huawei to be given equal opportunities to bid for business, and during the operational process, if you find anything wrong, then you can charge them and accuse them,"" the Chinese-born Zhao said. ""But if we don't have anything then to put them on the blacklist - I think this is not fair."" Zhao was speaking on the day South Korea'sSamsung Electronics won the race to commercially launch 5G services, saying 5G-enabled smartphone Galaxy S10 would allow games to be played with minimal delay, potentially changing the landscape of the gaming industry. Zhao said it was in the interest of telecoms companies to ensure that they were using secure hardware, because otherwise they could face a challenge by national authorities or a public backlash against using their services. ""So it's their first concern, their first target, to make sure that the systems they use in the market will provide service satisfaction to them."" The ITU will hold a meeting in October to finalise standards for the 5G spectrum, but concerns about Huawei will not slow down that process, Zhao said. The ITU also has a study group of national experts looking into security. ""Up to now we don't have any proposal from anybody on 5G security concerns there,"" Zhao said. The study group includes an official from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as well as an official from Chinese telecoms firm ZTE Corp. ",24.17999999999938,1

The airline told investors that it is expecting to earn 85-95 cents per share during Q1, up from its earlier estimate of 70-90 cents, on an adjusted basis. Delta's shares have jumped 3% since the announcement. However, Delta's upbeat profit outlook for Q1 is merely one of the many factors driving airline stocks at present. Bullish forecast by Airlines for America (A4A) in the last week of March indicated a significant jump in airline operations through Mar 1- Apr 30, which is the spring travel season. According to A4A, the industry trade organization for leading U.S. airlines, American airlines can expect an all-time high of 158.2 million passengers to fly worldwide during the mentioned period, marking a 4.3% jump from the same period last year. This demand has led to domestic airlines adding 129,000 additional seats per day to accommodate the higher passenger inflow. U.S. consumers' satisfying flight experiences and better financial well-being are increasing demand for air travel (according to the University of Michigan, U.S. consumer sentiment climbed in Marchto 98.4 from February's 93.8) Secondly, applications for unemployment benefits declined to a 49-year low in the last week of March, indicative of the prolonged strength in the U.S. labor market. Unemployment rate remained at 3.8.  Friendly Fiscal and Monetary Policies Current fiscal and monetary policies are extensively helping the airline industry. Be it President Donald Trump's tax law, which took effect in late 2017, or Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rate hikes at bay, airlines are greatly benefiting. Lower corporate tax cuts are definitely upping the bottom line of airlines and resulting in increased cash flows and higher savings. This means that airlines have more capital to spend on improving their infrastructure, add new facilities and engage in acquisitions. Frozen interest rates are helpful as well, since it makes it easier for carriers to take loans for infrastructure-related investments, which can be quite huge. Investing in Airlines is Lucrative Right Now: 3 Choices Given the aforesaid positives, investing in airline stocks seems prudent. In fact, the NYSE ARCA AIRLINE INDEX (XAL) has gained 1.9% since Apr 2, with many prominent airlines such as United Continental, American Airlines and Spirit, SkyWest SKYW and Atlas Air Worldwide AAWW registering a jump in price performance.

384," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AT&T (NYSE:
T
) finally is getting some love, with shares pushing through multiple resistance levels. I have been pounding the table on AT&T stock below $30 and we're finally seeing that bet pay off. Not that we haven't been compensated in the meantime with T's massive dividend yield, which is still at 6.4%.  The big question from those that have been on the sidelines: Is it too late to buy AT&T stock? The short answer is no, and those investors will likely get a better chance than what T stock currently offers. Investors are turning cautiously optimistic on the name, as the share price inches higher. Just a few days ago, AT&T stock gapped higher and has been treading water near $32. If we get a slight pullback down to $31 (which is very doable in my view) investors could be looking at a setup that has 10% upside in the stock price while getting paid more than 6.5% from AT&T's dividend yield. The first thing many investors look at with AT&T stock is the dividend . Since this yield is elevated vs. T's historical yield, the average dividend yield in the market and its peer Verizon (NYSE:
VZ
), many investors next look at the balance sheet. Admittedly, AT&T is a bit bloated, carrying $167 billion in long-term debt. However, that's down about $3.1 billion from the prior quarter. Some investors will say, ""So what? The debt is still massive!"" That's true. But a near 2% reduction quarter-over-quarter after just closing its massive $85 billion Time Warner acquisition isn't bad. Management has stressed multiple times at this point its intentions to pay down debt and maintain its dividend payout. AT&T still has some divesting potential, like selling its Hulu stake to Disney (NYSE:
DIS
), that will allow it to pay down debt, and its free cash flow (FCF) is very strong. The Time Warner deal will boost this metric and really, that's what matters. Strong FCF can be used to pay and raise the dividend, and more quickly pay down debt. As it stands, AT&T stock trades at just under 9 times this year's earnings, while analysts expect modest growth this year and next. We're not in this name for the growth though. We're in for a high dependable yield that we can find in few other places. AT&T has not only paid, but has actually raisedits dividend for 35 straight years. That gives us confidence the payouts will continue higher. In late-March, Raymond James upgraded AT&T stock to outperform and slapped a $34 price target on the name. This is a realistic upside target given that some of T's negative catalysts are dying down and positive catalysts are taking hold. Click to Enlarge I wanted to show both a weekly chart, which is above, and a daily chart below. This helps investors see multiple levels and different moving averages. It also helps show where potential support and resistance levels may rest. For instance, On the daily chart below, you may notice that AT&T stock is now above all of its major moving averages. Shares can really heat up now, right? Perhaps. But notice on the weekly chart the 100-week moving average is holding T stock in check. Should it push through, it has the 200-week moving average near $32.75 that could keep a lid on it. Click to Enlarge So how do we do we trade this mess? Well, the setup is actually quite simple. T stock has been very orderly over the past few years. For the most part, downtrend support has buoyed AT&T stock on each test over the past few years. On the upside, downtrend resistance has been very consistent and limited the stock's run. For bulls, it would be incredibly healthy to see AT&T stock pullback to its prior breakout zone and hold that level. Should this development occur, it sets up for a bigger move later this year and $33+ is a reasonable expectation. Further, a pullback to this area will land T stock near its 200-day moving average at $30.71. However, within about 25 cents sits the 20-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages. Along with prior resistance, these moving averages should support AT&T stock. If so, this is the perfect buying opportunity in T stock for 10% upside and a 6.5% dividend yield.

385," For Immediate Release Chicago, IL -April 5, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Boeing BA , American Airlines AAL , Southwest Airlines LUV and United Airlines UAL . Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog: What to Expect for Boeing's (BA) Q1 Earnings? Shares of Boeing have fallen over 8% since a 737 MAX aircraft was involved in a deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash. The aerospace giant's stock slipped 1.5% again Wednesday as new reports surfaced that suggest the pilots followed Boeing's emergency steps to combat a sudden downturn of the nose. With that said, until all the information is out, investors might want to simply see what to expect from the company's upcoming first quarter fiscal 2019 financial results. Quick Overview Ethiopian Airlines pilots reportedly initially followed Boeing's emergency procedures for dealing with the sudden downturn of the nose of their plane but were unable to regain control, according to a new Wall Street Journal report . Boeing in a statement asked that people not speculate until the preliminary crash report and flight data from the plane are both released. What we do know for sure at this point is that a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff on March 10 and killed all 157 people on board. Similarities to an October Lion Air crash of the same new Boeing model led to the grounding of all 737 MAX planes. There is currently an investigation underway into the cause of the accident. And we should note that Boeing has met with American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and many others in order to review software upgrades and much more. Meanwhile, the 737 MAX fleet remains grounded. Outlook & Earnings Trends Obviously, there is still a ton of uncertainty. But shares of Boeing are up roughly 20% this year to outpace its peer group, which includes European rival Airbus, among others. The Chicago-based firm expects to deliver between 895 and 905 new commercial aircraft in 2019 to help it easily top 2018's previous record of 806. With that said, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Boeing's first quarter 2019 revenue to climb 3.8% to reach $24.27 billion. This would fall far short of Q4's 14% expansion but Boeing easily surpassed our estimate last quarter. Plus, Boeing's full-year 2019 revenues are projected to jump 9.5% to $110.70 billion. At the bottom of the income statement, Boeing's adjusted Q1 earnings are expected to climb 16.8% to reach $4.25 a share. Peeking further ahead, the company's Q2 EPS figure is projected to skyrocket 41.4%, with full-year earnings expected to climb 25.6%. On top of that, the chart below shows that Boeing's earnings estimate revision activity has remained largely positive recently, especially for fiscal 2019 and 2020, despite the headwinds. Bottom Line Boeing is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) based on its earnings estimate revision trends and also has a strong history o f quarterly earnings beats. This includes a 17% avera ge earnings surprise over the trailing four periods. Nonetheless, at this point, some investors might want to wait to buy BA stock until we see how damaging the official report is. Boeing is scheduled to release its Q1 2019 financial results on April 24. Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future?

386," United Technologies Corporation 's UTX unit, Collins Aerospace Systems, recently unveiled its $50-million investment plan for a modern electric power systems laboratory, namely The Grid in Rockford, IL. This investment constitutes a portion of Collins Aerospace's total investment plan of $150 million targeted at electric systems over the coming three years. Notably, the development of the 25,000-square-foot laboratory is already in progress and is likely to be functional by 2021. On completion, the facility will be dubbed as the most advanced electric power systems laboratory in the industry. This will support Collins Aerospace in designing and testing high-power generator systems for the next generation of electric aircraft including business aviation, commercial, military, UAV and urban air mobility platforms. As a matter of fact, The Grid will also allow the company's advanced products group in developing a hybrid-electric flight demonstrator platform, dubbed as Project 804. The facility will support the project's objective to re-engine a regional turboprop aircraft driven by a hybrid-electric propulsion system. The facility will enable the company to develop and test a 1 megawatt motor, motor controller and battery system. This will in turn ensure the success of the project. Notably, once developed, the 1 megawatt motor will be the most power dense and fuel-efficient as yet in the aerospace industry. Existing Business Scenario United Technologies is well poised to gain from strength in commercial and military aftermarket businesses, coupled with continued revenue passenger mile growth in the quarters ahead. Also, growth in GTF engine production, continued investment in innovation and service transformation, as well as launch of new products, particularly at the Carrier segment, are likely to drive the company's Commercial business revenues. It intends to become more competent on the back of meaningful business acquisitions. In this regard, the buyout of Rockwell Collins (completed in November 2018) is worth mentioning. Notably, this deal is expected to not only fortify the company's existing product portfolio but also aid in launching innovative solutions for aerospace customers. Moreover, the acquisition of S2 Security (in October 2018) and Predikto (in August 2018) will likely strengthen its revenues and profitability. In the past three months, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has returned 24.1%, outperforming the industry 's gain of 18.7%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF , Foot Locker, Inc. FL , Costco Wholesale Corporation COST and Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI . Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog: 4 Undervalued Retail Stocks with Earnings Growth Potential ""It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."" - Warren Buffett. Smart investors often consider value style as one of the most-effective approaches. In value investing, the focus is on stocks that are trading below their inherent worth but are fundamentally sound. An investment decision based on the intrinsic value of stocks seems feasible in an economy that is coping with waning consumer confidence, Brexit and slowing global economic environment. Definitely, these raise concerns. However, efforts to resolve the U.S.-China trade spat, the Fed's dovish stance and increase in construction spending for the third successive month in February sounds good. Given the current market scenario, adding a few top-ranked stocks with a favorable Value Score and solid earnings growth potential seems prudent. Among the 16 Zacks sectors, we are focusing on Retail & Wholesale . Why Retail Sector? A strong labor market and gradual wage acceleration are favoring the Retail & Wholesale sector. The space seems to be faring better when compared with a host of other sectors, at least in terms o f earnings and revenues. This is clearly visible from the picture unfolding for the first quarter of 2019. Per the latest Earnings Preview , the sector is likely to register top and bottom-line growth of 7.3% and 2.9%, respectively. On the other hand, total S&P 500 revenues are envisioned to improve 4.6%, with earnings expected to decline 4%. The report also suggests that the sector is likely to continue its momentum going forward with growth expected on both ends in the remaining three quarters. Consequently, revenues and earnings are projected to increase 8% and 6%, respectively, in 2019. 4 Prominent Picks We have shortlisted stocks on the basis of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A or B. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings portray growth rate of 10% or more for the current fiscal year. We suggest investing in Abercrombie & Fitch Co. with a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.3% and a Value Score of B. This specialty retailer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 88.3% in the trailing four quarters. The stock, which sports a Zacks Rank #1, has estimated earnings per share growth rate of 20.9% for the current fiscal year. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . Another stock worth considering is Foot Locker, Inc. , which has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.4% and Value Score of A. This athletic shoes and apparel retailer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9.7% in the trailing four quarters. The stock, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1, has an estimated earnings per share growth rate of 10.4% for the current fiscal year. Investors can also count on Costco Wholesale Corporation , which operates membership warehouses. This Zacks Rank #2 company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.9% and a Value Score of B. The company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.5% in the trailing four quarters. The stock has estimated earnings per share growth rate of 15.8% for the current fiscal year. Darden Restaurants, Inc. , which owns and operates full-service restaurants, is a solid bet with a Zacks Rank #2 and Value Score of B. The company with a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3% posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.7% in the trailing four quarters. The stock has estimated earnings per share growth rate of 20.2% for the current fiscal year.

388," WASHINGTON/NAIROBI, April 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Friday it had killed a woman and child in a 2018 airstrike in Somalia, the first time the military has acknowledged its strikes caused civilian casualties in the country. U.S. Africa Command said the April 1, 2018, strike near El Burr, Somalia, had killed two civilians and four militants, not five militants as the U.S. military had originally reported. Major General Gregg Olson, director of operations at U.S. Africa command, told reporters a subordinate organization of Africa Command had concluded by the summer of 2018 that civilians had been killed in the strike. In a statement, Africa Command said it believed the civilian fatalities were an ""isolated occurrence."" There has been increasing concern about the pace of strikes in Somalia and the civilian casualties that they may be causing. Amnesty International said last month it had documented 14 civilians killed in investigations of five airstrikes, a tiny fraction of those the United States says it has launched. Africa Command said the April 1, 2018, strike was not one of those investigated by Amnesty and that it was committed to ""credibility, transparency, and accountability."" The U.S. military has carried out 28 airstrikes in Somalia in 2019, compared with 47 in 2018 and 35 in 2017. Most publicised strikes are followed by information on the number of militants believed killed. While the strikes against al Shabaab militants have increased recently, it is unclear what lasting impact, if any, the strikes are having on the militant group. Al Shabaab wants to overthrow the weak U.N.-backed Somali government and impose strict Islamic law. ",24.17999999999938,1
389," Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value? This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 18.10. If we focus on the stock's long-term PE trend, the current level puts HD Supply Holdings' current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 16.32) over the past five years. Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.42. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.   We should also point out that HD Supply Holdings has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 12.18, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for HD Supply Holdings' stock in the near term too.

P/S Ratio

Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.

Right now, HD Supply Holdings has a P/S ratio of about 1.29. This is considerably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.30 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.

Broad Value Outlook

In aggregate, HD Supply Holdings currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes HDS a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.

For example, the PEG ratio for HD Supply Holdings is just 0.81, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.26. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.86, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 12.12. Clearly, HDS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.

What About the Stock Overall?

Though HD Supply Holdings might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B. This gives HDS a VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>
) Meanwhile, the company's recen t earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen five estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen three upward and three downward revisions in the same time period.

This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 3.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen 1.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:  HD Supply Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus   HD Supply Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus | HD Supply Holdings, Inc. Quote This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.

Bottom Line

HD Supply Holdings is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 31% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below: So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.

390," CEVA (NASDAQ: CEVA)  is a relatively small company -- with a market capitalization  just shy of $600 million -- that develops and licenses out digital signal processor (DSP) intellectual properties (IP) that chipmakers integrate into their designs to perform specialized calculations. Under CEVA's current business model, the little-known company generates an up-front licensing fee for its IP and is also paid royalties whenever chips incorporating that IP are sold in the marketplace. After reviewing the company's recent analyst day materials, I'd like to go over three interesting long-term growth opportunities for the semiconductor IP specialist and see if it's a good investment.  Image source: Getty Images. CEVA's DSPs have long been licensed by makers of cellular baseband chips for smartphones. In fact, according to the company, about 66% of its revenue in 2013 came from licensing fees and royalty payments from smartphone baseband chip sales. Over time, the company has sought to diversify its business -- something that both reduces risks and opens additional growth opportunities -- but even during the first three quarters of 2018, 44% of its sales came from smartphone baseband chips. Now, smartphone baseband applications should continue to be critical to CEVA's business over the long term. After all, smartphones aren't going anywhere, and the company seems to be well positioned to capitalize on the imminent industrywide transition to 5G wireless. What's interesting, though, is that CEVA indicated that it sees significant opportunities in cellular chips beyond smartphones. The company recently talked up how the move to more advanced LTE as well as 5G networks will necessitate ""state-of-the-art DSP solution[s] to face new baseband requirements."" CEVA also highlighted how it has ""established a tight collaboration with 3 of 5 Tier 1 OEMs"" in a bid to make IP that's custom tailored to their needs. This, the company claims, ""results in the most sophisticated DSP architectures"" and ""presents the competition with very high entry barriers."" Beyond base stations, CEVA is also talking up the opportunity in the Internet of Things (IoT). The idea here is that as more devices become cellular enabled -- something that many think will be catalyzed by the 5G transition -- there will be a corresponding increase in the need for CEVA's related IP. Another area that CEVA is bullish on is the market for advanced computer vision processing. According to the company, the total market for devices with computer vision/artificial intelligence capabilities is set to swell in the coming years. There will be, per CEVA, ""[more] than 1.5 billion cameras with computer vision/machine vision shipping by 2022."" That 1.5 billion breaks down as follows: 800 million from smartphones, 70 million from surveillance devices, 375 million from consumer electronics like cameras, 300 million from automotive, and 150 million in industrial. To capitalize on this opportunity, CEVA says that its strategy is based on four pillars. Two of them are hardware based and include the company's NeuPro AI processor and CEVA-XM, which is described as a ""highly parallel processor for imaging and computer vision."" The other two pillars consist of its neural network software compiler (a compiler is a piece of software that translates human-written code into something that the computer can process) as well as its suite of software development kits. CEVA's DSPs are used in many cellular baseband processors, but the company's technology is also useful in chips that handle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity as well. The company claims that by 2022, the number of devices shipping with Bluetooth connectivity will hit 5 billion and the number of Wi-Fi-enabled devices should hit about 3.7 billion. (Many of these devices will have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, so we're not necessarily talking about 8.7 billion distinct device shipments.) So, CEVA is going to try to capitalize on those large and growing market opportunities. The company seems to be making solid progress. According to CEVA, its Bluetooth and Wi-Fi IP has been shipped in more than 1.5 billion chips to date. With respect to such chip shipments, CEVA also claims that it has enjoyed a ""50% annual growth rate between 2014 [and] 2018."" It also says that it has more than 150 customers for these designs and that it inks in excess of 25 new deals each year. And finally, CEVA highlighted the fact that it's ""consistently first with [the] latest standards,"" something that should give it a technology edge over rivals. CEVA's growth strategy certainly looks credible. The company has a good position in smartphone baseband chips today and its efforts to capitalize on other markets such as computer vision and non-cellular connectivity look promising, too. Its aim is to more than double its royalty revenue in 2022 relative to where it was in 2018. It's also hoping to roughly double its operating margin and triple its earnings-per-share leverage by that time. CEVA's financial targets are by no means a slam dunk -- it'll need to execute extremely well to reach them -- but if CEVA can pull it off, then the stock could trade significantly higher than it does today by the time 2022 winds to a close.  10 stocks we like better than CEVA

391," The Clorox Company CLX is gaining momentum on the back of its smooth progress on 2020 Strategy, focus on e-commerce and brand-management initiatives. In addition, the company is benefiting from its strategic buyouts coupled with higher pricing and cost-saving efforts. Apparently, it delivered ninth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise in second-quarter fiscal 2019. Factors Narrating Clorox's Growth Story

Clorox's 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at driving growth at product categories and enhancing overall market share, is encouraging. The strategy focuses on increasing net sales by 3-5%, expanding EBIT margin by 25-50 basis points and generating free cash flow of 10-12% of sales, all on a yearly basis. Markedly, the 2020 Strategy is expected to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands; development of e-commerce; technological advancements; enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds - desire, decision and delight.

Meanwhile, Clorox remains keen on making strategic partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities in both physical world and online. As a result, Clorox witnessed an improvement in digital capabilities leading to a strong performance in e-commerce, which is now a significant revenue contributor. Notably, the company is ahead of its plan to achieve $500 million from e-commerce sales by 2020.

Clorox also has a diversified brand portfolio, which positions it well to deliver growth and sustain in the challenging macro landscape. The company's approach toward brand management allows each of its brands to develop further through rigorous research and development, marketing strategies, financial control and operating leverage. In addition, management is focused on making investments in demand building including digital marketing, e-commerce and product innovation pipeline.

Furthermore, Clorox's price increases and cost savings are providing a boost to gross margin. However, the margin growth was somewhat hurt by elevated commodity, and manufacturing and logistics expenses. In fiscal 2019, management expects gross margin to remain flat as gains from higher prices and cost-saving efforts are expected to be offset by increased costs and adverse foreign currency exchange rates.

Although Clorox continues to anticipate gross margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, it expects a muted growth due to the shift in supply-chain spending toward the back half. Moreover, the company expects EBIT margin to decline on flat gross margin expectations, and plans to complete the Nutranext integration and invest strongly in advertising to support the strong back-half innovation plans.

Nevertheless, gains from product innovations and buyouts are expected to drive Clorox's top and bottom lines. Management projects sales growth of 2-4% from the fiscal 2018 level. Innovations are likely to deliver about 3 percentage points of additional sales. The top line is also likely to reflect the combined positive effect of the Nutranext acquisition and the Aplicare divestiture to the tune of 3 percentage points. Also, fiscal 2019 earnings per share of $6.20-$6.40 from continuing operations, includes nearly 8-12 cents benefit from the Nutranext acquisition. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year is currently pegged at $6.33.

Bottom Line

Although issues related to higher costs and foreign currency translations persist, we believe these concerns will be offset by Clorox's impressive strategic efforts. Also, a VGM Score of B and long-term earnings growth rate of 6.4% demonstrates the stock's inherent potential.

394," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Canadian cannabis giant Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:
ACB
) stock turned heads in early April when the company announced intentions to raise $750 million through a mixed-shelf offering over the next 25 months.  On the surface, it's a bit of shocker. Aurora is one of the biggest marijuana stocks in the world. It's growing very rapidly and has healthy margins. Thus, the need to raise cash does raise some eyebrows, and it has created weakness in ACB stock. The question now is ""why."" Why does one of the world's biggest cannabis companies need to raise $750 million? The answer is pretty simple. Aurora only has $110 million in cash on its balance sheet. Its three biggest marijuana stock peers all have much more cash than that, while two peers have billions of dollars in cash sitting on the balance sheet. The implication? All of Aurora's peers have more investment firepower than Aurora, and two of them have much more firepower. That's not good, considering the cannabis industry is in its early stages wherein big investments today will be rewarded with big growth tomorrow. Consequently, Aurora needs to raise $750 million, mostly to grow its investment firepower to be more on par with peers. Doing so will enable Aurora to grow more quickly, more adequately defend its early leadership position amongst marijuana stocks, and most importantly, dive into the ultra-valuable U.S. market, where Aurora has zero presence today. All in all, the shelf offering is actually good news for ACB stock. The one thing holding this stock back has been the company's lack of resources to compete at scale. That headwind will be remedied by a capital raise, meaning ACB stock should be clear for takeoff. The plain English here is that Aurora needs more money on its balance to compete at scale with its more heavily backed peers. And because no big consumer staples company has come knocking yet with a billion dollar offer, Aurora is finally looking to raise that money on its own. Broadly speaking, the cannabis industry is in the early stages of a long-term growth trajectory. In early-stage growth markets, investment is critical to long-term success. A company that invests wisely today, will reap the rewards of that investment tomorrow through market share gains in a rapidly growing market. Meanwhile, marijuana stocks that do not invest today, will suffer tomorrow as they lose share to peers who did invest.
Click to Enlarge At the moment, Aurora risks falling into the latter category. Two of Aurora's peers, Canopy Growth (NYSE:
CGC
) and Cronos (NASDAQ:
CRON
), have scored multi-billion dollar investments from global consumer staples giants. Their balance sheets are shored up with billions of dollars for investments, partnerships, and expansion. Canopy has over $3 billion in cash. Cronos is set to have nearly $2 billion. Aurora, meanwhile, hasn't scored such a big deal, and cash on the balance sheet measures a meager $110 million. Hypothetically, that means for every investment Aurora makes, Cronos can make 20 of them, and Canopy can make 30 of them. Ultimately, that positions Aurora to lose share in the global cannabis market. Adding $750 million to the balance sheet changes things. That would put Aurora's cash firepower at $860 million. That's much more respectable next to the billion-dollar cash balances at Canopy and Cronos. Thus, with this discrepancy narrowed, Aurora will have the necessary resources to compete at scale with its more heavily backed peers.  In the big picture, this $750 million will help Aurora attack the soon-to-be-huge and super important U.S. cannabis market. The U.S. cannabis market is still in its early stages, but it is rapidly growing and projects to be huge one day. Multiple states have legalized cannabis, hemp is now legal across the country thanks to the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, and many close observers are optimistic that nationwide marijuana legalization isn't far away. Consequently, many Canadian cannabis giants, such as Canopy Growth, are positioning themselves to likewise dominate what analysts see as a $100 billion U.S. cannabis market. One Canadian cannabis company that hasn't jumped into the U.S. market yet? Aurora. And it's not because they don't want to. Back in January 2019 , Aurora chief corporate officer Cam Battley said that the company would be announcing a ""hemp-derived CBD strategy to enter the U.S. market over the next few months."" It's April 2019, and we still haven't heard much of a concrete plan with respect to that expansion strategy. To be sure, the company has expanded its presence in Europe dramatically during that stretch. But, nothing has been firmly announced on the U.S. expansion side. Why? Presumably due to a lack of resources. Canopy is making moves in the U.S. market with $3 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Next to that, Aurora can't do much with $100 million. But, with $860 million, the playing field is much more even. Aurora can finally make some noise. Overall, then, I see this $750 million raise as being the fuel for Aurora to finally push into the U.S. cannabis market. That's big news for ACB stock. The one thing holding this stock back has been its inability to expand reach given lack of resources. That will all change if the company uses newly raised growth capital to push into the U.S. market. A move of that magnitude would likely result in a healthy rally for ACB stock. On a pure valuation basis, ACB stock is as cheap as it gets in the cannabis space. This relative undervaluation can be chalked up to a lack of financial resources on the balance sheet. But, this headwind is disappearing, and as it does, the relative undervaluation gap in ACB stock should disappear, too, meaning this marijuana stock could be gearing up for takeoff. As of this writing, Luke Lango was long CGC and ACB. The post Why Aurora Cannabis Needs to Raise $750 Million appeared first on InvestorPlace . ",24.17999999999938,1
395," Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 18.10. If we focus on the stock's long-term PE trend, the current level puts Fortune Brands Home's current PE ratio noticeably below its midpoint (which is 22.93) over the past five years.  Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.42. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.  We should also point out that Fortune Brands Home has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 13.28, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Fortune Brands Home's stock in the near term too.

P/S Ratio

Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.

Right now, Fortune Brands Home has a P/S ratio of about 1.27. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.30 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.  If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.

Broad Value Outlook

In aggregate, Fortune Brands Home currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes FBHS a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.

For example, the PEG ratio for Fortune Brands Home is just 1.49, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.85. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.64, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 11.47. Clearly, FBHS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.

What About the Stock Overall?

Though Fortune Brands Home might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives FBHS a VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>
) Meanwhile, the company's recen t earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and three lower, while the full year estimate has seen two downward and no upward revisions in the same time period.

This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 2.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined 2.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:  Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Price and Consensus   Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Price and Consensus | Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Quote This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.

Bottom Line

Fortune Brands Home is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 39% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below: So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.

In three month's time, the stock has rallied 26.5% compared with its industry 's and the S&P 500's 15% and 12.5% growth, respectively. Additionally, DENTSPLY has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.2%. Notably, this trend of consecutive beats underlines the company's operating efficiency. With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment. Factors That Bode Well Emerging markets offer healthy growth opportunities for DENTSPLY, on a long-term basis. This is because they remain vastly untapped with low dental products penetration. Growth in these markets is being driven by consumables, technology and equipment performance. DENTSPLY's exceptional strength in its products, brands, clinical education, direct sales and marketing efforts have been providing it with a competitive edge in these places. Last year, DENTSPLY opened several training facilities in places like Vietnam and Indonesia, and expanded its selling organizations in these high potential markets. In the fourth quarter of 2018, revenues from the Rest of the World (ROW) inched up 1.4% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, the company foresees high-single-digit growth opportunities in the Asia Pacific, Latin America and China. Management expects contributions from emerging markets to continue in the quarters ahead. In a bid to revolutionize digital-implant workflow in dental care, DENTSPLY recently launched a single tooth replacement solution - Azento - in the United States. By 2019, it will be available in Canada and Europe. Azento reduces the risk of complications in single-tooth replacement procedures. It is a unique dental platform that will help dentists select the best-fitting implant, optimal implant positioning and feasible healing environment. It revolutionizes the digital implant workflow by restructuring implant-planning service, purchase and delivery. A report by the Meticulous Research states that the global tooth replacement market is expected to reach $13,035.2 million by 2022, at a CAGR of 6.9%. Which Way Are Estimates Trending? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings is pegged at $2.32, reflecting 15.4% growth year over year. The same for revenues stands at $4.02 billion, up 0.8% year over year.  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

Like the first two months of 2019, the U.S. auto sales trajectory persistently declined in March. This uninterrupted fall in auto sales has placed automakers, which are already struggling with weakening conditions in other major global market s, in a tight spot. The sales decline was due to consumers abandoning passenger cars for larger and more-comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs as well as soaring vehicle prices and unfavorable interest rates. Among the leading auto manufacturers, Detroit-based General Motors Company, which doesn' t report monthly sales anymore, witnessed 7% decline in vehicle sales for first-quarter 2019 from the prior-year quarter. Ford Motor Company is another auto manufacturer that doesn't release monthly figures anymore.

Myoungshin, a unit of MS Autotech, affirmed that it will buy the land and buildings of the General Motors facility to undertake contract manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs). Notably, General Motors closed one of its four South Korea plants in late May and axed several workers. This move, which was in sync with the automaker's strategy to restructure operations, eventually gained huge financial support from the South Korea government. Per a provincial government release, Myongshin is part of a consortium, which, to start with, would invest 200 billion won on the factory. The plant will produce 50,000 EVs, starting from 2021 and 150,000 EVs in 2025. Moreover, per the North Jeolla Province government, the electric car factory would create 900 jobs, and another 2,000 at suppliers and other firms. South Korea's electric car supply chain and free trade deal with the United States and Europe will aid this plant. (Read more: General Motors to Sell Closed Car Factory in South Korea ) General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. 3.    Lear Corporation announced that it inked a definitive agreement to acquire Xevo Inc., the Seattle-based Tier-1 automotive software supplier. This acquisition is likely to combine e-commerce vehicle platform technology of Xevo with the Southfield, MI-based leading supplier of automotive seating and electrical systems, Lear's proficiency in electronic systems. In other words, this is likely to broaden Lear's connectivity offerings, with a leading-edge technology platform. Presently, Xevo's technology is available in more than 25 million vehicles located mainly in the United States. Moreover, there are considerable opportunities for expansion of Xevo's technology in North America, Europe and Asia. Nevertheless, per the deal, all outstanding shares of Xevo will be acquired by Lear for $320 million. The transaction, which is scheduled to close in second-quarter 2019, is likely to be executed through debt financing. Over the next year, Lear plans to launch a number of programs within Seating and E-Systems segments. Its developmental programs and partnerships along with production contracts are expected to drive financials in 2019. The Xevo acquisition will advance Lear's leadership position in reshaping the global automotive industry. This will allow Lear to enhance capabilities in software, services and data analytics. (Read more: Lear to Acquire Xevo to Expand Connectivity Offerings ) Lear currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 4.    Ford is set to introduce four plug-in hybrids and two battery-powered vehicles in a bid to recover from losses incurred in the European market, per Bloomberg. At the beginning of 2019, the U.S. automaker announced restructuring the business to recover money-losing regional operation. At present, automakers are struggling in Europe due to slackening vehicle sales and tightening emission regulations. From the upgraded SUV line-up, Ford will offer Explorer in a PHEV variant, revamped Kuga plug-in hybrid and compact Puma in a mild-hybrid variant. The new Puma will be manufactured at its hub based in Craiova, Romania, and is expected to reach showrooms by the end of the year. Beside SUVs, Ford will launch an all-electric Transit van for the commercial market by 2021. Further, a plug-in hybrid version of the Transit van will be available in the market this year. Apart from upgraded model launches, the company is reviewing operations in Britain, if the country exits from the European Union without a deal. Ford operates two engine factories in Britain. Last month, the company announced that it was moving out of the Russia market, with three plant closures. Beside this, it plans to slash workforce in Germany and the U.K. This automaker currently employs roughly 54,000 people in Europe. Apart from sluggish vehicle sales, mounting costs are hurting Ford's profitability in the region. With an aim to reduce expenses, it is partnering with peer companies. In January, it announced that it collaborated with Volkswagen AG. Per the partnership, the companies will build commercial vans and pickups, and explore electric and autonomous technological developments. Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. 5.    Tesla, Inc.'s vehicle production and delivery numbers witnessed sequential declines of 10.9% and 31%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2019. It managed to produce roughly 77,100 vehicles - consisting of 62,950 Model 3, and 14,150 Model S and X. Out of the total delivered figure of 63,000 units, Tesla's Model 3 accounted for 50,900 while Model S and X were 12,100. During the quarter, this electric automaker struggled with Model 3 deliveries to Europe and China, owing to longer transit time. Nevertheless, several analysts anticipated the fall in deliveries as Tesla shifted to international markets with Model 3 for the first time. The company started delivering new Model 3 to China and Europe markets in January and February, amid a slowdown in demand in North America. Tesla's Model 3 shipments to international markets faced a few bumps in the last quarter, per Reuters. Misprinted labels delayed the shipments' arrival in Shanghai while it faced unexpected challenges at the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.
Longer transit time to deliver in international markets will likely to hurt Tesla's working capital. The company reported having 10,600 vehicles in transit at the end of the quarter compared with 1,900 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Apart from managing transit time for international shipments, Tesla has to compete with Europe automakers that are launching several versions of electric vehicles, per Reuters. Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Performance Last week, all the stocks gained. Harley-Davidson, Inc. gained the maximum while Toyota gained the least.

398," Cannabidiol, or CBD, occupies a peculiar space in the U.S. healthcare universe right now. Extract it from the hemp plant, and it's legal. Extract the identical chemical from the closely related marijuana plant, and it's a Schedule I controlled substance. When it's sold by a mainstream pharmaceutical company, after being tested and approved to treat epilepsy, it's a legitimate drug. But other companies can sell CBD without any of that regulator-reviewed scientific testing by calling it a ""supplement."" Put it in a cream or lotion? Acceptable. Put it in food or drink? That's against the rules...but the FDA mostly ignores the companies that do it. Next month, the Food and Drug Administration will hold its first public hearings on whether to allow the compound to be legally used as an ingredient in food and drink, and in this segment from MarketFoolery , host Chris Hill and analyst Emily Flippen consider what it could mean for businesses in and around the legal marijuana space, the supplements segment, and the food and beverage sector. A full transcript follows the video.   10 stocks we like better than Walmart
When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of January 31, 2019
The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.  This video was recorded on April 3, 2019. Chris Hill: The Food and Drug Administration announced its first public hearing on legalizing CBD in food and drinks. Speaking of food and beverages. That's going to be on May 31st. We had talked last week about CVS and then Walgreens starting to sell CBD lotions, topical cannabis products, in their stores. This will certainly be an interesting hearing to watch unfold. When you look at this in your role, not just as an analyst but as co-advisor of one of our marijuana investing services, who stands to benefit from this? Emily Flippen: There's a lot of companies that both stand to benefit and lose from the potential outcomes of this hearing. To be clear, a lot of people who are interested in this space don't necessarily spend all their day researching the industry like the analysts here do. Hill: Right. The listeners have jobs. Flippen: [laughs] Exactly! Hill: They're going to school, they have jobs. They're like, ""No, that's why I listen to you people."" Flippen: So, to clarify the difference between cannabis and CBD and THC. CBD is derived from the hemp part of cannabis, which was legalized in December. However, you'll see CVS, Walgreens, they're selling CBD products, but they're topical products. They don't have to go through the FDA to get approval. Anything that involves CBD that's being sold as a dietary supplement, that's what's affected by this upcoming hearing. Right now, virtually every company that's selling CBD is violating FDA orders by selling it as a dietary supplement. They haven't been very proactive in going after these companies unless they've been the companies that are making extremely egregious claims -- like that CBD will cure cancer or Alzheimer's. Those are the companies they're going after. But for basic companies that are just selling CBD oil and saying, ""It's a dietary supplement, order online!"" the FDA is acknowledging, ""Hey, you're outside the bounds. We're not going to go up against you, but we are going to put a hearing on and determine whether or not CBD, A. should be sold as a dietary supplement; and B. should be sold in food and drinks."" At the moment, you can't put CBD in any sort of edible or drinkable product. It's interesting, CBD is acting in this space where it's both a drug, because there is a CBD-based drug that has been FDA approved for epilepsy, and also acting as a dietary supplement. Those two things are naturally against each other. You're not going to be able to go and buy a controlled substances off the shelves of your local grocery store. The FDA has a big job ahead of them, determining how they're going to handle CBD if it's both a drug, but also being used as a dietary supplement. Hill: Depending on the outcome of this hearing, do you expect to see another wave of investment, in the same way that last year we saw large companies, whether it was Altria , Coca-Cola , Pepsi , either making direct investments, or at leas t report edly looking into investments? Should we expect some other wave coming depending on the outcome of this? Flippen: Yes, for sure. I'm a big fan of making unsubstantiated claims. [laughs] I really do believe that the FDA is going to give approval for CBD to be used once it's proven safe and effective in things like food and drinks. I fully expect, once the FDA has given that final stamp of approval, we're going to see a huge wave of investment into CBD, which is why I said I think companies stand to both benefit from it and lose from it. If you're one of the companies that's making these egregious claims, yeah, they're going to crack down on you. But if you're one of the companies that's selling your products maybe a little bit under the table, admittedly, at this time, once you get that approval, it opens up so many doors.

399," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) and Apple (NADAQ:
AAPL
) have a complicated relationship. They are often rivals, but at the same time they rely on each other in some ways. That relationship has been adversarial in the past, but recently thawed when Amazon began carrying Apple devices and its Echo smart speakers picked up the ability to play Apple Music. Now AMZN is reportedly coming after one of Apple's most successful products - AirPods - with its own Alexa wireless earbuds. When they are released, it may just mark a point where the relationship between the two companies turns cold again…  Amazon's secretive Lab126 hardware division has turned out some very popular devices, including the Kindle e-readers, Fire TV tablets and Amazon Echo smart speakers. When word leaks that the Lab126 is working on a product, the impact to the target market can be immediate - and it's usually bad news for existing players. Last year, when word got out that Lab126 was working on what turned out to be the Fire TV Recast (a live TV recorder), Tivo (NASDAQ:
TIVO
) stock took a 4.3% hit on the news . Late yesterday, Bloomberg published a report saying that Amazon's Lab126 is currently working on Alexa wireless earbuds that are intended to take on Apple's popular AirPods . According to Bloomberg's sources, they will look like the AirPods and function in a similar fashion to the AirPods, but with Alexa instead of Siri. Users will be able to use Alexa for hands-free music control, to ask questions and of course to order products online. However, it sounds as though AMZN is intending to make its own offering even more compelling than AirPods by targeting superior audio quality - one of the key complaints about the AirPods. That strategy would be somewhat ironic, given one of the key selling points of Apple's HomePod smart speaker is that it offers superior audio to Amazon's Alexa smart speakers. The HomePod was far more expensive than an Echo but given Amazon's strategy of offering hardware at or near cost, the Alexa wireless earbuds are expected to instead undercut Apple's pricing. Unlike Tivo, Apple stock didn't reflect any investor concern about this news. That may change if Amazon's offering is a hit, instead of the miss that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:
GOOG
, NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) Google Pixel Buds turned out to be . There is definitely some money to made in selling wireless earbuds. The devices are popular and becoming more so as smartphone manufacturers increasingly eliminate headphone jacks. They are expected to be a $10 billion market by 2023 , and at the moment, Apple's AirPods hold about 60% of that market.  AAPL is counting on wearables like the Apple Watch and the AirPods to help take some of the heat of slowing iPhone sales off Apple stock. For Amazon, the prospect of capturing a chunk of wireless earbud market likely wouldn't have a material impact on its bottom line, especially if the company follows its pattern of selling them without regard to making a profit. The key to the Alexa wireless earbuds is Alexa. Shut out of smartphones, Amazon snuck its personal assistant into contention by putting it in its Echo Smart speakers. The Echo got Alexa into the home, and Alexa wireless earbuds offer a sneaky way to take Alexa mobile. With billions of Android and iOS smartphones out there - the vast majority of them using Google Assistant and Siri instead of downloading Amazon's Alexa app - a pair of really good sounding, affordable wireless earbuds could be the Trojan Horse that finally gets AMZN's Alexa onto smartphones in a meaningful way. That would mean Alexa gets ""smarter"" thanks to machine learning applied to the increased usage. More importantly for Amazon stock, it would translate into more customers buying Prime memberships to listen to Amazon Prime Music, and it would result in more online purchases thanks to the convenience of having Alexa in your ear everywhere you go. However, if they are successful, Alexa wireless earbuds will inevitably turn into a friction point between Apple and Amazon. AirPods are one of AAPL's big success stories and the company talks them up whenever possible. Bloomberg says the Alexa wireless earbuds are expected in the second half of the year, setting up a showdown between Amazon and Apple just in time for the holiday shopping season - when earbuds are a hot gifting commodity. That battle for holiday sales could also mark the point where the AAPL and AMZN relationship chills once again. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

400," RPM International Inc. 's RPM shares spiked 2% after i t report ed third-quarter fiscal 2019 results, wherein earnings and revenues topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 14 cents in the quarter, beating the consensus mark of 11 cents by 27.3%. However, the reported figure declined 33.3% from the year-ago period.  RPM International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise RPM International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | RPM International Inc. Quote Operating Highlights

Gross margin decreased 60 basis points (bps) year over year in the fiscal third quarter, owing to higher raw material and freight costs.

Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the reported quarter came in at $46.9 million, down 17.3% year over year. Adjusted EBIT margin of 4.1% also declined 100 bps year over year.

Segment Details

The company has three reportable segments - Industrial, Specialty and Consumer.

Industrial Segment (contributing 50.9% to net sales): Sales in the segment increased 2.1% from a year ago to $580.9 million, given strong performance across the businesses providing corrosion control coatings, fiberglass grating, commercial sealants, and concrete admixture and repair products. However, foreign exchange and challenging international market partly offset the segment's positives. Notably, this segment has the largest international exposure.

Organic sales growth was 4.8%, while acquisitions added 1.3% to net sales. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 4%.

Consumer Segment (33.8%): Sales improved 6% on a year-over-year basis to $385 million during the quarter, owing to 5.3% organic sales growth. Acquisitions contributed 2.7%, whereas foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by 2%. Favorable trend of market share gains contributed to the segment's growth.

Specialty Segment (15.3%): Sales increased 2.7% from the prior-year period to $174.7 million on the back of 0.6% organic sales improvement and 3.4% acquisition growth during the said quarter. However, foreign currency translation impacted sales by 1.3%. The segment gained from marine coatings, exterior cladding systems, fluorescent colorants businesses and benefits from the acquisition of Nudura in September 2018.

Balance Sheet

As of Feb 28, 2019, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $195.2 million compared with $244.4 million at fiscal 2018-end.

Long-term debt (excluding current maturities) at the end of the quarter was $2.07 billion compared with $2.17 billion at fiscal 2018-end.

In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, the company had cash from operations of $145.5 million compared with $140.7 million in the corresponding period of fiscal 2018.

Guidance

The company expects net sales to grow in the low-single-digit range during the fiscal fourth quarter, which is seasonally the strongest quarter. It also expects to witness double-digit EBIT growth, resulting from price increases and moderating raw material cost.

Resultantly, for the fiscal fourth quarter, its earnings are expected in the range of $1.12-$1.16 per share, higher than the year-ago level of 63 cents and the consensus estimate of $1.12 (considering the mid-point of the guided range).

404," Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) shares outpaced the market last month by rising 12% compared to a 1.8% uptick in the S&P 500, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence . The rally added to a strong period for the stock, which is up 43% so far in 2019 and has jumped 70% in the past full year.  Image source: Getty Images. The spa and beauty products retailer announced solid holiday-quarter results last month. Sales gains accelerated for the second straight quarter, with comps growth landing at 9.4%. The chain's past moves to trim inventory, meanwhile, allowed it to sell more full-priced items so that gross profit margin improved after falling in recent quarters. CEO Mary Dillon and her team are predicting that sales gains will slow to between 6% and 7% in 2019 from this past year's 8% increase. The company is also planning to be more deliberate with spa openings, with 80 set to launch this year compared to 100 in 2018. Still, the chain believes healthy customer traffic, both in stores and online, should support stable operating margins and earnings of between $12.65 per share and $12.85 per share, for a double-digit increase over last year's result.  10 stocks we like better than Ulta Beauty

406," Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 18.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Encore Wire's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.  Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products-Services sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.23. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.  We should also point out that Encore Wire has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of 14.58, which is higher than the current level. So, it is fair to expect an increase in the company's share price in the near term.

P/S Ratio

Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.

Right now, Encore Wire has a P/S ratio of about 0.96. This is a lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.  If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.

Broad Value Outlook

In aggregate, Encore Wire currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Encore Wire a solid choice for value investors.

What About the Stock Overall?

Though Encore Wire might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B. This gives WIRE a Zacks VGM score - or its overarching fundamental grade - of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >> )

Meanwhile, the company's recen t earnings estimates have been upbeat. The current quarter has seen one estimate go up with no downward movement. For the full year, the estimate has seen one upward revision in the same time period with no movement in the opposite direction.

This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 9.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen 22.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: Encore Wire Corporation Price and Consensus  Encore Wire Corporation Price and Consensus | Encore Wire Corporation Quote This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.

Bottom Line

Encore Wire is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 5% of more than 250 industries) and Zacks Rank#1 boosts our confidence.

However, over the past two years, the Zacks Wire & Cable Products industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:  We believe, despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance, a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Encore Wire.

407," At Home Group Inc. HOME is exploring a range of strategic options that include the sale of the company, per Reuters. The company has appointed Bank of America Corp. to find a potential buyer. However, At Home Group has declined to comment on the matter. Although the company has lost 39.2% against the industry 's 5% growth in a year's time, it took a sharp U-turn following the news. Evidently, the stock gained nearly 8% yesterday. Despite reporting robust sales growth of more than 20% year over year in each of the trailing 19 quarters, At Home Group has struggled to find a safe haven. Shares of the company have been declining as it is bearing the brunt of rising raw material, freight and transportation costs, higher marketing and advertising expenses, and stiff competition. The aforementioned factors have impacted the company's earnings as well. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2019, adjusted earnings declined 6% year over year.   Furthermore, At Home Group issued tepid guidance for first-quarter and fiscal 2020. The company projects adjusted earnings to decline more than 90% in the first quarter from the year-ago period. Also, for fiscal 2020, its adjusted earnings are likely to decrease 21.5-16.9% on a year-over-year basis. Further, the specialty retail home furnishings and decor businesses are highly competitive. At Home Group competes with other retailers that deal with similar kind of merchandises. The company also competes with national, regional and local businesses that follow a similar retail store strategy as well as with existing big box retail, department and specialty stores. Substantial sales growth in the retail industry in the last decade has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. Increased competition can reduce sales and ultimately hurt operating results and businesses going forward. Zacks Rank & Key Picks At Home Group, which shares space with RH RH , carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

410," Myriad Genetics, Inc. MYGN recently announced the expansion of companion diagnostic (CDx) partnership with AstraZeneca AZN and Merck & Co., Inc. MRK . The companies have again come together to use BRACAnalysis CDx to find germline BRCA mutations in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate (mCRPC) cancer enrolled in the Phase III PROfound (NCT02987543) study. On successful completion of the study, Myriad Genetics plans to file a supplementary premarket approval application with the FDA for using BRACAnalysis CDx as a CDx to Lynparza (olaparib) in the patient population mentioned above. Market Potential Per the American Cancer Society, around 174,650 new cases of prostate cancer are estimated to be diagnosed in the United States in 2019. Moreover, 42,970 new cases of mCRPC are expected to get registered in 2019. As a matter of fact, prostate cancer is considered the second principal cause of cancer death in American men. Hence, we believe that the recent development is a timely one and will help Myriad Genetics boost top-line contributions in the near term. Regulatory Tidings for BRACAnalysis The partnership between Myriad Genetics and AstraZeneca on Lynparza had commenced in 2007. Since then, BRACAnalysis CDx has received multiple regulatory approvals. In February 2019, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare approved the use of BRACAnalysis CDx as a companion diagnostic to discover patients with germline  BRCA  mutated ( BRCA m) advanced ovarian cancer and eligible for first-line maintenance therapy with Lynparza. Last December, the company announced FDA approval for the use of BRACAnalysis CDx test to identify patients with germline BRCA mutation, suffering from advanced ovarian cancer and suitable for first-line maintenance therapy with AstraZeneca's PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitor - Lynparza - following response to platinum-based chemotherapy. In January 2018, the FDA approved BRACAnalysis CDx as a companion diagnostic for the same as above. Price Performance Over the past year, Myriad Genetics' share price has outperformed the  industry .

411," Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX , also known as BD, is expected to benefit from a slew of developments and a strong guidance for fiscal 2019. However, raw material pricing pressure is a headwind. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Price Performance Shares of BD have rallied 14.3%, comparing favorably with the industry 's rise of 3.3% in a year's time. The current level is also better than the S&P 500 index's 8% rally.  What's Deterring the Stock? BD expects raw material pricing pressure, which increased in 2018, to accelerate in fiscal 2019 on resin price increases owing to a supply-constrained market. Although pressure from raw materials partially eased in the fiscal first quarter, management expects a 2% headwind from it in fiscal 2019. Additionally, BD expects a 1% tariff headwind in 2019. Customer ordering patterns are also expected to affect second-quarter results. Why Should You Retain BD? BD has reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2019. On a reported basis, BD continues to expect fiscal 2019 revenue growth of 8.5-9.5%, primarily owing to the C. R. Bard acquisition. At cc, the same metric is anticipated to increase 5-6%. Fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share are projected between $12.05 and $12.15, reflecting growth of 13-14% at cc and 10% from fiscal 2018. The midpoint of the latest guidance of $12.10 is slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.09. The company has also seen a slew of developments in recent times. Last month, BD announced the CE-IVD certification for the BD FACSDuet automated flow cytometry system. Notably, the instrument enables clinical laboratories to improve efficiency by reducing errors.

Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus | Becton, Dickinson and Company Quote Which Way Are Estimates Headed? For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.59, reflecting a decline of 2.3% on a year-over-year basis. The same for revenues is pinned at $4.22 billion, reflecting growth of 0.03% year over year. Bottomline BD seems to be positioned for growth, courtesy of a plethora of positive developments amid raw material pricing pressure.

413," In the modern world of digital investing, it's easy to forget that shares of stock used to be tangible: Companies issued paper stock certificates, possession of which proved that you, for example, owned 100 shares of the American Cotton Oil Company. As such, they had real value. But do they still? In this mailbag segment from the Rule Breaker Investing podcast, listener Bill Halsley has stumbled across a circa-1937 Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company stock certificate that once belonged to his great-uncle. The company itself was bought long ago by Union Pacific. But does the certificate still have value? To answer, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner has recruited Motley Fool Director of Small Cap Research Bill Mann, who will explain why that stock may no longer be...well, stock, but how it could be art. A full transcript follows the video.   10 stocks we like better than Walmart
When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of January 31, 2019
The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.  This video was recorded on March 27, 2019. David Gardner: Bill Halsley's question, he said: ""Dear David, This is short. This belonged to my great-uncle. I've discovered this company was eventually sold to Union Pacific. I don't know what to do with it."" Bill includes a picture of a stock certificate. The company is Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company. Like a lot of these certificates, this is a beautiful piece of art. Bill Mann: It's gorgeous! Yes. This is from the 1930s -- 1937 is when it was executed. So, obviously, the company doesn't exist anymore. But there are plenty of places where this stock certificate itself, particularly if it's in good condition, could net Bill a lot of money. Gardner: Is that right? Mann: I would take it to any coin and stamp store. One of the things that they also will do is, they will deal in old certificates. It's called scripophily. Gardner: S-C-R-I-P-O-P-H-I-L-Y? Mann: Yeah. Scripophily. Gardner:  Dot-com? Mann: Yeah, scripophily.com. It's the collection of stock certificates. I actually recently on scripophily.com bought a share certificate just like this from my grandfather's company, which was called Cannon Mills, which is a textile company from Kannapolis, North Carolina. So yes, I can speak to this both as someone who loves collecting these kinds of things and just loves old stock certificates; but also, as someone who has recently been on the other side of this transaction. Gardner: That is a great reminder, because truly, as I read Bill's question -- first of all, I haven't had this experience, so I was like, ""I have to have an expert in from The Motley Fool,"" and we got Bill Mann this week, which is awesome. But I was just thinking: ""Maybe Union Pacific paid something for this company that's decent. Union Pacific is still around. Maybe this is worth a lot of money."" But you're pointing out that whether or not that's true -- and it might be -- the artwork itself, and collectors, there's a whole market out there for these kinds of certificates. Mann: Yeah. There's something called escheat rules. Probably, if there's been sitting around -- what escheat is, it says that after a period of time, the company might consider the shares abandoned. He should absolutely check with Union Pacific. I'm guessing that they have long ago struck these shares from the register. Gardner: I see. So you're not going to find out that you're a millionaire. Mann: You could! Gardner: This is 1937. We're 82 years later right now. So, probably there's no stock market value to this. You can't claim 1% ownership of Union Pacific at this point. Mann: Highly unlikely. But it's worth checking. Union Pacific might want to get their hands on this stock certificate. They might think that that's a pretty cool thing. But it would be fabulous. I hope Bill lets us know what happens. But, yeah, because of the escheat rules, I think of this as what a collector would do with it. I guarantee you that's not worth zero. Gardner: Really cool! Last question for you, Bill, before I let you go. I'm not asking you how much you paid to buy that certificate. But typically, I'm sure a lot of us are wondering, what is the typical price for a handsome piece of art and actual stock certificate from 80 years ago? Are these $500? $1,000? Are we talking a lot more than that, or less? Mann: It certainly can be. What Bill has in his hands is something that's very special, because there are railroad collectors. Railroads and power companies and things like that, but especially the railroads. The other one that tends to be worth a lot is old Disney certificates. They can be upwards of $500. I'm really curious to know what comes of this. Bill Mann has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. David Gardner owns shares of Walt Disney.

414," Hurt by losses in the past few quarters, Nomura Holdings NMR plans to achieve $1 billion costs savings in its Wholesale business. It intends to meet this target through layoffs and branch closures over the ""medium term"", with 60% of the overhaul completed by the end of next fiscal year (March 2020). The company incurred net loss of $907 million in the nine months ended December 2018 due to which it seeks to shut down at least 30 of its 156 retail brokerage branches across Japan. At its annual investor day held on Apr 4, Nomura stated that its Wholesale business is suffering from lower trading revenues in fixed income and constant corporate expenses, which led to the decline in segment's revenues by 24% in fiscal year ended March 2019. Japan's largest brokerage firm is also planning to trim its international business due to struggles in global trading operations. Also, Nomura seeks to transform its business portfolio by digitizing the trading platform and focusing on origination business, while reducing operations in the secondary markets. The company said in a press release, ""Nomura is facing a major structural shift in its business, driven by changes in the regulatory environment, advances in digitalization, as well as evolving client needs due to Japan's declining birth rate and aging population."" Group Co-COO, Toshio Morita said that the company would now be closely aligned to client's needs, which is expected to boost revenues in the future. Instability in global equity and bond markets, and weak investment banking performance have greatly affected Nomura's performance. Thus, the brokerage firm's efforts to transform its business platform by tapping on growing areas seem impressive. Shares of Nomura have lost nearly 24.4% over the past six months compared with the industry 's decline of 9.4%.  Currently, Nomura carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

415," There are certain types of co-workers who can really ruin your workday. Chronic gossipers, for example, can be a major distraction and pull you into conversations you'd rather not have, while know-it-alls can make you want to crawl under your desk and hide there indefinitely. And then there are the constant complainers -- the people who never seem satisfied and aren't shy about voicing their displeasure. If you're stuck working with one of them, here's how to cope. Separating yourself from a perpetual complainer is a good way to reclaim a bit of your sanity. Therefore, think about the ways you might manage to distance yourself from that whiny officemate. You can ask to relocate your desk, for one thing. Or you might try altering your schedule so that your hours don't overlap quite as much. The more space you create, the less exposure you'll have to those constant gripes.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Maybe you can't physically distance yourself from the office complainer, but what you can do is change the topic when it turns overly negative. Granted, this may not work all the time, but if you manage to divert the conversation a few times a day, you'll avoid some of the negativity your co-worker is clearly trying to spew. For example, if your colleague starts whining about deadlines, you might say, ""I know, it's hard being under pressure, but did you see that announcement about the new vacation policy? How cool is that?"" Complaining is clearly an unfavorable trait, but before you give up on your whiny co-worker, try to see if there's a pattern to his or her displeasure. For example, if he or she often moans about having too much work and too many deadlines, it could be that your colleague feels overwhelmed or insecure. And if that's the case, you can offer advice on how to address those issues rather than continue listening to that person moan and groan all the time. It's one thing to be a supportive colleague by listening to what your co-workers have to say and serving as a sounding board when they're clearly having a hard time. But there comes a point when you can no longer subject yourself to the same old complaints coming out of the same mouth all the time. If, despite your best efforts, you're unable to get a break from your perpetually displeased colleague, sit him or her down and have an honest conversation. Explain that the constant moaning is getting you down and that you'd rather not get sucked into a spiral of negativity. But say so delicately and, if possible, offer to help. For example, you might say something like this: ""I see that you're having a hard time at work, but your frequent complaining is getting me down. Is there anything specific I can help you with that might improve your situation here?"" Of course, you'll need to be prepared to make good on that offer, but you're better off lending a hand than listening to nothing but grievances. Dealing with a resident complainer is far from fun. If you can't avoid or minimize the problem, talk to your colleague and try to make a clean break. If anything, that might be just the wake-up call he or she needs to stop moaning and start having a better attitude at the office.  The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook

417," The Computer and Technology group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole?

Palo Alto Networks is one of 642 individual stocks in the Computer and Technology sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #8 in the Zacks Sector Rank.

Notably, the BOFA International acquisition added 1.4% to sales growth while pricing had a positive 1.3% impact and other items added roughly 0.3%.

Notably, Off-Road sales in the reported quarter were flat year over year. Revenues generated from Industrial Products (accounting for 33.4% of net sales in second-quarter fiscal 2019) amounted to $234.7 million, increasing 5.6% from the year-ago quarter. This year-over-year improvement in the reported quarter was driven by 13.5% growth in Industrial Filtration Solutions' sales, partially offset by 16.7% decrease in Gas Turbine Systems' sales and 3.6% fall in Special Applications' sales. Gross Margin Fall Y/Y, Operating Margin Flat In the reported quarter, Donaldson's cost of sales increased 7.3% year over year to $478.3 million.

432," It has been about a month since the las t earnings report for ABM Industries (ABM). Shares have added about 9.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ABM Industries due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recen t earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. ABM Industries Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1 ABM Industries first-quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings (from continuing operations) of 31 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents and increased 19.2% year over year. The bottom line benefited from higher margin revenue contribution and the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606. Total revenues of $1.61 billion increased 1.2% year over year on the back of 2% organic revenue growth (excluding the adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 853). Revenues by Segment Business & Industry revenues (48% of total revenues) increased 2.4% year over year to $774.5 million. Technology & Manufacturing revenues (15%) climbed 1.7% year over year to $236.1 million. Technical Solutions revenues (7%) increased 3.7% year over year to $107.9 million.  Aviation revenues (16%) declined 2.9% year over year to $252.4 million. Healthcare revenues (4%) decreased 1.6% year over year to $66.7 million. Education revenues (13%) of $204.7 million decreased 1.1% from the prior-year quarter. Operating Results Adjusted EBITDA of $68.8 million increased 5.7% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 18 basis points (bps) to 4.3%. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $20.8 million, up 19.7% year over year. Adjusted operating income margin was 1.3%, up 20 bps from the prior-year quarter. Operating expenses increased 1.2% from the year-ago quarter to $1.45 billion. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.4% from the year-ago quarter to $112.7 million. Balance Sheet & Cash Flow ABM Industries exited fiscal first-quarter fiscal 2019 with cash and cash equivalents of $30.6 million compared with $39.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. Long-term debt was $945.8 million compared with $902 million at the end of the prior quarter. Net cash used in operating activities was $39.3 million in the reported quarter. Dividend Payment ABM Industries paid a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share, leading to $11.9 million of total dividend payment in the reported quarter. Additionally, the company's board of directors announced a cash dividend of 18 cents per share, payable on Mar 6, 2019 to shareholders of record as of Apr 4. This marks the 212 th consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the company. Fiscal 2019 Guidance ABM Industries reaffirmed its fiscal 2019 guidance for adjusted income from continuing operations in the range of $1.90-$2.05 per share. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Fresh estimates followed a downward path over the past two months. The consensus estimate has shifted -6.67% due to these changes. VGM Scores At this time, ABM Industries has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy. Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in. Outlook ABM Industries has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months. ",24.17999999999938,1
433," Investors looking for stocks in the Medical - Dental Supplies sector might want to consider either Dentsply International (XRAY) or Conmed (CNMD). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look. We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits. Dentsply International has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Conmed has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that XRAY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CNMD has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use. XRAY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21.68, while CNMD has a forward P/E of 33.71. We also note that XRAY has a PEG ratio of 2.25. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. CNMD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.93. Another notable valuation metric for XRAY is its P/B ratio of 2.18. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CNMD has a P/B of 3.50. These metrics, and several others, help XRAY earn a Value grade of B, while CNMD has been given a Value grade of C. XRAY stands above CNMD thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that XRAY is the superior value option right now.",24.17999999999938,1

436,"By Brett Owens Sometimes investors forget tha t dividends are funded by actual cash flows . Consider General Electric ( GE ) , whose outsized yield tempted investors to mistakenly buy shares in this aEURoeblue chipaEUR as disaster was unfolding. The stock losses started well before the actual dividend cut and continued on from there: (Accounting) Imagination at Work This focus on yield rather than cash happens too often.

One of Blockforce CapitalaEURtms ETFs, the DIVCON Dividend Defender ETF ( DFND ) , was actually short GE for a time before its dividend cut. Today we tap DIVCON to identify five stocks with solid dividends. Each of these stocks, which yield anywhere from more than 5% to 10.8%, earns a DIVCON 4 or 5 score. Philip Morris (MO)
Dividend Yield: 5.2%
DIVCON Level: 4 Philip Morris markets products like Marlboro, L&M and Parliament, among others, in more than 180 markets. It has moved into tobacco alternatives, including iQOS heat-not-burn systems and Solaris e-vapor products. DIVCON sees Philip MorrisaEURtm dividend as plenty safe, and for good reason. The payout has grown for years and the companyaEURtms free cash flow has grown along with it. Unfortunately the dividend is safe and sleepy . PM has essentially been dead money over the past five years. PM simply faces an ever-squeezing fist of international pressure against tobacco products. OK on Cash, Challenged on Growth AbbVie (ABBV)
Dividend Yield: 5.3%
DIVCON Level: 5 AbbVie (ABBV) might have put together a rocky past couple of years, with its stock leaping from roughly $65 in 2017 to around $125 in 2018 back down to its current perch above $80. But donaEURtmt sweat the dividend. AbbVieaEURtms payout has more than doubled from 49 cents per share in 2015 to its current level at $1.07. ThataEURtms covered by just a little more than half the companyaEURtms free cash flow, which has exploded from $7 billion in 2015 to $12.8 billion last year. ThataEURtms important, because that means AbbVie can pump money into its R&D to keep its development pipeline flowing. While Wall Street has been fretting HumiraaEURtms exposure to the patent cliff, it still has a blockbuster in cancer drug Imbruvica, and has potential annual billion-dollar products in cancer treatment Venclexta and endometriosis treatment Orilissa. That, in turn, should keep the generous dividend well-covered, and give ABBV time to get up off the mat. Lazard (LAZ)
Dividend Yield: 6.0%
DIVCON Level: 4 Lazard (LAZ) is a high yielder that many investors tend to ignore because of its boring business and a name that mostly goes unknown to the consumer class. Lazard is an asset management company aEUR"" and not a particularly large one at that, at $4.3 billion in market cap aEUR"" that offers mutual funds, advises on mergers & acquisitions and more. It shares a marketplace with the likes of Goldman Sachs (GS) , UBS (UBS) and AllianceBernstein (AB) , which is part of why itaEURtms so difficult for it to find the spotlight. LetaEURtms consider that so far in 2019, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is the top M&A advisory at $182 billion in transaction value across 25 deals. Lazard is 22nd at $10.8 billion across just nine deals. Lazard has been a laggard over the past decade, gaining only about 3% on a total-return basis (without its generous yield, thataEURtms a 23% loss!) That said, the company has produced roughly 23% growth in both revenues and profits during that time, and the stock is underpriced less than 9 times forward estimates. Lazard also is a aEURoesneakyaEUR high-yield dividend stock. LAZaEURtms headline yield of 4.7% is nothing to sneeze at, nor is its 11-year streak of dividend hikes. But Lazard also pays out a special dividend based on the companyaEURtms profits, and has done so for seven straight years. ItaEURtms a policy I love because it demonstrates responsible fiscal management, plus itaEURtms a nice kicker to an already attractive yield. When you throw in this yearaEURtms 50-cent special dividend, that translates into a substantial 6% yield. Lazard (LAZ): Is The Price Finally Right? Six Flags (SIX)
Dividend Yield: 6.6%
DIVCON Level: 4 Theme park operator Six Flags (SIX) is a comeback story if there ever was one . It filed for bankruptcy in 2009, but it cleared its debt load, brought in new leadership and even started paying a dividend again in 2011. It really put the pedal down on that payout, too, starting from a split-adjusted 3 cents per share back then to its current payout of 82 cents. Since coming back, SIX has ripped off more than 400% returns for investors, though that has come with a precipitous fall in the past year or so. You can blame that on a small bubble burst in its valuation prompted by weak results, especially on the top line. Earlier this year, Six Flags posted a wide beat in earnings (93 cents per share were down year-over-year, but still way better than the 25 cents analysts were looking for), but the top line missed by almost 6%. Analysts are expecting pretty tepid growth ahead, which makes me wary of dipping my toe in at the moment. At the same time, Six Flags did post its ninth record year of revenues, and net income grew year-over-year. The dividend continues to grow. Cash and profits are both still enough to cover that payout, and SIX also has enough cash to keep buying out its stock (about $111 million worth in 2018). So while IaEURtmm not encouraging a rush into shares, it is clear to see why DIVCON sees little to worry about concerning the dividend right now. Moelis & Co. (MC)
Dividend Yield: 10.8%
DIVCON Level: 4 Moelis & Co. (MC) is another high-yielding asset management company a la Lazard. It provides financial analysis, helps raise capital and advises on deals. With a 2.5 billion market cap itaEURtms even smaller and less noticed than Lazard. Looking back at that same list of M&A advisers, Moelis is 26th at $5.8 billion in transaction across 11 deals. But the company is growing like a weed, including 2018 revenues of $886 million (up from $552 million in 2015) and free cash flow of $384 million (up from $139 million). YouaEURtmre paying a bit more than underpriced LAZ, at under 14 times forward estimate, but youaEURtmre getting a company that appears to have more upside potential. Moelis & Co. (MC): An Underappreciated Growth Dynamo Moelis is also like Lazard in that it pays special dividends aEUR"" and again, it tends to be more supercharged than its peer. Moelis pays about 4.6% in yield based on its regular dividend of 50 cents per share aEUR"" itself a massive 150% improvement from 2015 levels. But MC also pays out special dividends, sometimes twice a year. Over the past 12 months, Moelis has paid out two special dividends of $1.25 and $1.50 per share. When you add up all its payouts over the trailing 12 months, the stock has delivered a stunningly high yield of nearly 11% ! Retire on DIVIDENDS ALONE With This aEURoeUltimateaEUR Portfolio I love aEURoesneakyaEUR dividend stocks like Lazard and Moelis because theyaEURtmre wildly undercovered by the analyst community, which means theyaEURtmre usually underpriced, and that income aEURoekickeraEUR is fantastic for total returns. But theyaEURtmre not perfect holdings for retirement because you canaEURtmt quite count on those special dividends always being there, in the exact amount you need, exactly when you need them.

437," By Robin Emmott and Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS, April 5 (Reuters) - Tensions over trade, investments and minority rights are preventing China and the EU from agreeing a joint declaration at a summit next week, multiple sources in Brussels said on Friday, sapping a European push for greater access to Chinese markets. Alarmed by potential Chinese dominance of strategic European industries, EU leaders last month sought to prepare for the April 9 summit - flagged as an opportunity to cement bilateral ties - by agreeing what they said was a more assertive stance towards Beijing. Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, has recommended rejecting the statement as it stands, according to an EU source. China had not met EU hopes that it would open its markets, nor seriously committed to reforms of global trade rules. According to an early draft put forward by the European Union and seen by Reuters, Beijing would be bound into completing talks on an investment agreement and committing to remove what the EU says are unfair barriers to trade. The EU also wants to show the United States that the trade war route is not the only way to coax Beijing to open up. But Chinese officials have removed or changed many of those references, the EU diplomats said, raising the embarrassing probability of no communique at all after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk have met. Envoys for EU nations including Britain, Germany and France said they could not back the communique on the basis of China's changes, an EU official said. Other EU references to reassure Europeans that China is committed to confronting attacks by computer hackers and improving religious freedoms for the Muslim Uighur minority are also proving very difficult, the diplomats said. ""We wanted to be clear on how we want to work with China, not issue a meaningless document,"" a senior EU diplomat said. Another said there would be no statement without a change in stance from Beijing. The Chinese foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. Vice Foreign Minister Wang Chao told reporters this week that both sides were working to reach a consensus. Negotiations with the Chinese would continue until Tuesday.  RE-EVALUATION The intensification of EU diplomacy since March reflects frustration over China's reluctance to allow foreign companies to set up there without restrictions while taking full advantage of the EU's openness, EU diplomats say. A surge of Chinese takeovers in critical sectors in Europe and an impression in Brussels that Beijing has not kept its promise to stand up for free trade and globalisation have given the April meeting new urgency. The EU-China relationship, which is bound by 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) in daily trade, has survived previous spats, notably in 2016 and 2017 when differences over the South China Sea and trade meant there were no communiques. However, after a collective re-evaluation of Chinese policy by EU leaders on March 21, the six-page April 9 statement was meant to coax Beijing into making good on promises to deepen trade ties.

438," Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 18.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Belden's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.  Further, the stock's PE also compares pretty favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products-Services sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.23. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.  We should also point out that Belden has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of 9.51, which is tad higher than the current level. So, it is fair to expect an increase in the company's share price in the near term.

P/S Ratio

Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.

Right now, Belden has a P/S ratio of about 0.88. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.  If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.

Broad Value Outlook

In aggregate, Belden currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Belden a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.

For example, P/CF ratio comes in at 5.14, which is far better than the industry average of 6.65. Clearly, BDC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.

What About the Stock Overall?

Though BDC might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D. This gives BDC a Zacks VGM score - or its overarching fundamental grade - of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >> )

Meanwhile, the company's recen t earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen three downward revisions with no upward movement in the past sixty days. For the full year, the estimate has seen four downward revisions in the same time period with no movement in the opposite direction.

This has had an impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has plunged 35.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined 1.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: Belden Inc Price and Consensus  Belden Inc Price and Consensus | Belden Inc Quote Despite the bearish analyst sentiments, the stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.

Bottom Line

Belden is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. A strong industry rank (among top 5% of more than 250 industries) further instils our confidence.

However, a Zacks Rank #3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Wire & Cable Products industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:  So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.

440," Puma Biotechnology, Inc. PBYI announced that it has added two cohorts to the phase II SUMMIT basket study on Nerlynx (neratinib), which is currently being conducted for treating solid tumors in patients with activating EGFR, HER2 or HER4mutations. Nerlynx is already approved as an extended adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early stage breast cancer in adult patients, previously treated with Roche's RHHBY Herceptin-based adjuvant therapy. The phase II SUMMIT basket study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Nerlynx for solid tumors with activating EGFR, HER2 or HER4 mutations. The couple of new cohorts will enroll 18 patients each, who are afflicted with HER2-positive metastatic salivary gland cancer and EGFR exon 18 mutation-positive lung cancer. Notably, last month, Puma Biotech posted updated interim results from the same study on a different cohort, evaluating patients with HER2 mutated cervical cancer. Outcomes from the study showed that treatment with Nerlynx led to durable responses and disease control in metastatic patients suffering HER2-mutant cervical cancer. We would like to remind investors that Nerlynx was approved in the United States in July 2017 and in Europe last September. Sales of the drug have improved steadily since its launch and were above the management's expectations last year. For 2018, Nerlynx generated sales of $200.5 million, slightly higher than the company's guided range of $175-$200 million. Meanwhile, several label expansion programs on Nerlynx targeting different types of breast cancer patient populations and earlier-line settings are currently underway. Apart from the HER2-positive breast cancer indication, Puma Biotech believes that Nerlynx holds great prospects for addressing various other cancer types. The drug's label extension will thus allow treatment and access to a wider subject base, thereby boosting its sales in the future. Shares of Puma Biotech have soared 68.9% so far this year, outperforming the industry's rally of 14.4%.  Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider Puma Biotech currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector include Kamada Ltd. KMDA and PDL BioPharma, Inc. PDLI , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

441," Southwest Airlines LUV recently issued drab guidance for first-quarter 2019 revenues and costs. Multiple headwinds like the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets and the 35-day partial government shutdown were the primary reasons behind the bearish projections. These headwinds are likely to hurt revenues to the tune of $150 million. Additionally, non-fuel unit costs are projected to increase 10% during the first quarter of 2019.

442," Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ: SWIR) stock's steady start to 2019 came to an abrupt end in February after the company released underwhelming fourth-quarter 2018 results and guidance. The stock cratered big time , as investors were expecting the Internet of Things (IoT) specialist to step on the gas, but weakness in its largest business segment seems to be getting the better of it. Market intelligence firm IDC estimates that IoT spending will increase 14% in 2019. However, Sierra's flat revenue guidance for the year tells us that it isn't going to benefit from that trend. In fact, the company seems to be in a tough situation, as it has hired a third-party consultant to help it reduce costs and boost profitability. Let's see what's going wrong at Sierra and when investors might expect a turnaround.  Image Source: Getty Images. Sierra Wireless delivered impressive revenue growth of nearly 15% in 2018, though some of it was driven by the Numerex acquisition that boosted its IoT services revenue. More specifically, the chipmaker's IoT services revenue increased a whopping 161% in 2018 to $90.5 million on account of that acquisition, but that's just 11% of the total revenue. The OEM (original equipment manufacturer) solutions business, which supplies nearly three-fourths of Sierra's total revenue, increased just 5% in 2018. But the chipmaker is anticipating design losses in the PC OEM segment this year, which will be enough to offset automotive growth that will be driven by the ramp-up of two new programs at Volkswagen . Sierra admits that it shifted focus from the PC OEM space to focus on other fast-growing areas such as automotive, which eventually caused it to lose its footing. The company says it remains a ""meaningful supplier"" to certain Tier 1 and Tier 2 customers in PC OEMs, but CFO Dave McLennan made it clear during the latest earnings conference call that ""others will go away as the design wins end."" Additionally, the margins of the PC OEM business are higher than the entire OEM business's average, while automotive margins sit at a lower level. So it is not surprising that Sierra is expecting non-GAAP earnings of just $0.30 per share in 2019 as compared to last year's figure of $0.90 per share. Clearly, 2019 is going to be a painful year for Sierra Wireless, and a turnaround will arrive only when the company's OEM business starts picking up the pace. The company believes that the rollout of fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology will eventually boost the OEM business, so it is focused on developing new 5G products that will allow it to regain the lost PC OEM business. Sierra has already started making moves to regain lost ground in this space, displaying what it calls the ""industry's first 5G mechanical module sample"" at the Mobile World Congress. However, investors shouldn't expect quick gains, as the company anticipates it will be at least three to four years before such designs result in meaningful revenue gains. More specifically, Sierra management is targeting annual revenue in excess of $1 billion in the next three to four years. This means that the company should start delivering top-line growth from 2020 onward after a flat performance this year. Analysts estimate that the chipmaker will witness 8% revenue growth in 2020, which makes sense considering that two-thirds of  organizations surveyed by Gartner expect to deploy 5G by next year. Additionally, Sierra forecasts that its automotive design wins will deliver $1.1 billion in revenue over the next five years, and that excludes any new business that the company could land over this period. Sierra Wireless investors will need to be patient, as the stock might remain under pressure until there are concrete signs of a turnaround. This could present an opportunity to buy more stock on short-term weaknesses, since catalysts like 5G and connected cars should ultimately help it make a comeback from next year.  10 stocks we like better than Sierra Wireless

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Dave & Buster's Entertainment wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of March 1, 2019 This video was recorded on April 3, 2019. Chris Hill: Dave & Buster's had a pretty solid fourth quarter. Same-store sales came in higher than expected. Shares of Dave & Buster's up about 4% or 5% this morning. They look like they are doing a very good job of not only just operating well quarter after quarter, but also not really sitting on their hands. Emily Flippen: Yeah, definitely. They've been expanding aggressively. They've done a great job marketing this reformed Dave & Buster's, where it's a trendy, fun spot for adults to hang out after work or on the weekends. Been running a ton of promotions, including happy hours and food specials. Trimming down the business model to make it look sleeker and more exciting. Changing up the amusements to be more modern and high-tech. They're actually doing an impressive job. I will say that the company, while it beat on this quarter, they still expect same-store sales to be flat to the range of 0% to 1.5% over the next fiscal 2019. That to me is a little bit concerning, especially because you see this pop today, but ultimately, net income, while it beat expectations, it's still down 17% year over year. It's not like this is a really high-growth business. But they're definitely taking steps to change the brand and change the awareness of the company. Hill: Yeah. Some would, in the years past, derisively refer to this as Chuck E. Cheese for adults. To your point, they're doing a good job of refreshing the games that they have. They're also doing a good job of slimming down their menu and just saying, ""We just need to have enough food and make it be good enough."" They're doing a good job with the menu. The food menu is being slimmed down. They're doing a good job with their drink promotions. Think what you want about that, but that's a profit part of the business for them. So it seems like they're doing well on the operating level. Did you get a sense of any plans they have for expansion? I forget the company we were talking about, some retailer, last week. Maybe it was Five Below . I was really surprised by how many new locations Five Below is planning in this calendar year. Do you have a sense of what Dave & Buster's [is planning]? Among other things, management at Dave & Buster's has struck me as being pretty smart about not being overly aggressive in opening new locations. Flippen: Yeah, they're definitely not being as aggressive as someone like Five Below is. But, that's largely because Dave & Buster's already has a huge footprint. They are still expanding, though. They're net expanding. You mentioned the food. I know we're going to touch on this a little bit later, but they're doing a good job of staying trendy with their menu. One of the foods that they're bringing on is actually the Impossible Burger, a meat alternative burger. They're now offering that at their locations, as part of that slimmed-down menu. It's going to be a fun company to watch. I'm not really sold at this point, though. Chris Hill has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Emily Flippen has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Dave & Buster's Entertainment and FIVE. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .",24.17999999999938,1
444," Per CNBC reports, salesforce.com CRM along with other investors including Microsoft MSFT has spent $50 million on the identity verification start-up, Onfido. Onfido's latest financing round was led by salesforce's venture capital unit and the Japanese financial group, SBI, with additional support from Microsoft's venture arm and others. According to CNBC, Onfido's software ""validates a person's identity by taking their selfie and applying a mix of machine learning and human fraud experts to match their face with a government-issued ID."" The funding will be used for investing ""in the technology and in artificial intelligence (AI) component"", adds Onfido's management. Strategic Investments Add Stimulus to salesforce Investments in start-ups have always been one of salesforce's key growth strategies. Over the past few years, the company either acquired or partnered with many such companies. With these investments, the company aims to extend the capabilities of its platform and service offerings, increase the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies and create the next-generation of AI, mobile applications and connected products. Per the company's latest 10-K filing, as of Jan 31, 2019, it has made minority investments in more than 240 companies, which enable it to stay allied with the rapid pace of innovation that is taking place within the technology industry. The company invested in 95 companies last year. Furthermore, salesforce has acquired companies, which it has previously put money on. Notably, Mulesoft - acquired by salesforce in 2018 - attracted interest from the company in 2015, when a $128-million funding round was led by Salesforce Ventures. In March, Salesforce Ventures invested a significant amount in Kespry, a drone-based aerial intelligence solution provider, to boost its growth trajectory. Moreover, Vlocity, a developer of cloud solutions built on salesforce's customer relationship platform, raised $60 million from Salesforce Ventures among others. The company currently has several funds including the $50-million Australia Trailblazer Fund, $100 million Japan Trailblazer Fund, $100 million EMEA Fund, a $50-million AI Innovation Fund and so on. Per CB Insights, venture capital (VC) funding in AI start-ups is increasing rapidly. According to the firm, a record $9.3-billion capital resource was pumped into US AI start-ups last year, which is more than eight times the funding levels of $1.1 billion in 2013. We believe that salesforce's sustained focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth in the long run.  salesforce.com, inc.

445," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips U.S. stock futures are trading well into the green after the job market rebounded in March adding 196k in nonfarm payrolls. Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.36% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.29%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.41%. In the options pits, the action left little to chatter about which is often the case when volatility is subdued, and prices drift. Overall volume ended near average levels with about 17.6 million calls and 13.7 million puts changing hands on the day. The extreme readings in the CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio did cool yesterday. It popped back up to 0.59 while the 10-day moving average climbed to 0.63. Options traders were particularly active in Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
), Roku (NASDAQ:
ROKU
) and Disney (NYSE:
DIS
). Let's take a closer look:  Disappointing delivery numbers took Tesla out at the knees Thursday. The company reported it delivered 50,900 Model 3 cars in Q1 which fell well short of the expected 52,450 that analysts were anticipating. Traders were quick to punish TSLA stock. A flurry of sell orders at the open created a 10.3% down gap amid heavy volume. By day's end, buyers did emerge to pare the losses to 8.2%. To chart watchers, the continued weakness in Tesla shares shouldn't be surprising. The magnitude maybe, but not the direction. The stock has been locked in a downtrend all year long, complete with falling 50-day and 20-day moving averages. That said, significant support looms close at $250 so expect bulls to put up a staunch defense. On the options trading front, puts outpaced calls on the session. Activity swelled to 241% of the average daily volume, with 499,763 total contracts traded. Puts added 54% to the tally. Implied volatility fell on the day to 67%. That places it at the 40th percentile of its one-year range. The expected daily moves for the stock now sit at $11.32, or 4.2%.  Roku shares slid 6% after a Guggenheim analyst downgraded the stock from buy to neutral. The firm also lowered its price target from $77 to $72. Here's the money statement explaining the reasoning for their pessimism: ""We believe that the Apple video product unveiled on March 25 represents an additional risk to Roku's active user base (even as the platform includes The Roku Channel) while Amazon's and Viacom's greater pushes into advertising video on demand (AVOD) are increasing competition."" Given the stock's meteoric rise this year (it was up as much as 143%) you can't fault analysts for lowering expectations and wondering how much of the company's growth is already baked into the price. Despite the drubbing, ROKU stock remains in an intermediate-term uptrend with a rising 50-day moving average. The critical level to watch is support at $60. If we break it, watch out below. As far as options activity goes, the price drop was enough to push put demand higher than calls. By day's end, the total activity grew to 216% of the average daily volume, with 149,795 total contracts traded. Implied volatility jumped to 74%, placing it at the 53% percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are officially juiced and ripe for the selling. Short option strategies are very compelling here. Optimism from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:
GS
) boosted Disney shares 2% on Thursday after the investment bank reinstated its rating on Disney as ""buy."" Shares of the House of Mouse have been mired in the mud with little to show for its efforts over the past year. The $110 price level is acting as a powerful magnet, and despite numerous attempts, DIS has been unable to escape its grasp. Thursday's rally does look promising though. If it can clear resistance at $115.50, we could see a return to the record high at $120.20. Goldman's bullish chatter lit a fire under calls for the day. Activity grew to 176% of the average daily volume, with 159,656 total contracts traded. 65% of the sum came from call options. Implied volatility sits at 24% or the 36th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $1.72 or 1.5%.

447," For Immediate Release Chicago, IL -April 5, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon AMZN , Walmart WMT , Target TGT , Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog: Retail-Tech Partnerships Gain Steam: Should Amazon Worry? Amazon is going all out to bolster its presence in the grocery retail market. The company's endeavors are supported by its distribution strength, the acquisition of Whole Foods and the establishment of its cashier-less store, Amazon Go. Further, its strengthening grocery pickup and delivery services along with availability of Prime Savings at all Whole Foods Stores and Whole Foods Market 365 stores nationwide is a key catalyst for the company. However, Amazon recently slashed prices at Whole Foods that shows the cutthroat competition this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is facing from big retailers like Walmart and Target, to name a couple. These retailers are flexing their muscles against Amazon with support from tech giants like Alphabet and Microsoft. Further, they are ramping up their initiatives to strengthen their grocery services. Walmart-Google Partnership Poses a Challenge for Amazon Like Amazon, which offers the comfort of grocery shopping with voice commands using its Alexa, Walmart has introduced Walmart Voice Order that allows customers to place their grocery orders just by saying ""Hey Google, talk to Walmart"" using Google Assistant. With the availability of Google's voice assistant on several devices including Android phones, iPhones, smartwatches and Google Home Hub to name a few, Walmart's customer base is likely to increase. Users will be able to do grocery shopping from anywhere. Additionally, Walmart, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), also enables customers to shop for products listed on Google Express through voice commands. Target, Kroger Also in the Fray Another retail giant, Target partnered with Google to allow its customers enjoy voice shopping on Google Express in the United States. Further, there is a possibility of integration of Target's REDcard, a payment card, into Google's shopping platform. This will help the Zacks Rank #2 stock to deliver an enhanced shopping experience. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Apart from the voice shopping initiatives by Walmart and Target, Kroger, which carries a Zacks Rank #3, recently joined forces with Microsoft to take on Amazon's cashierless concept. Kroger will leverage Microsoft Azure that serves as the most preferred cloud platform for Retail as a Service (RaaS). Kroger is gearing up to establish two connected grocery stores with a new feature called EDGE Shelf (Enhanced Display for Grocery Environment) - digital shelf displays with real-time prices, promotions, nutrition and dietary information at two locations - Monroe, OH and Redmond, WA. Store specific data will be stored and processed on Microsoft Azure. Nevertheless, Amazon is likely to dominate at least in the near term owing to its rapidly increasing number of Amazon Go stores across the United States and focus on introducing cashierless technology in other countries as well.

448," A legislation that would change the way oil and gas drilling permits are issued in Colorado is on its way to Governor Jared Polis. The Senate voted 19-16 to concur on the amendments made to SB19-181 in the House. The regulation was approved along party lines, with Democrats voting in favor and Republicans voting in opposition. The push for the industry's overhaul gathered momentum after a deadly house explosion and fire in Firestone that killed two people and badly injured another in April 2017. The fatal event was traced to the seepage of an odorless gas from a line owned by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation APC . The Senate Bill 181 in a Nutshell The hotly debated and controversial measure, known as Senate Bill 181, is being referred to as 'the most sweeping oil and gas reforms' the state has seen. It will lead to a comprehensive overhaul of Colorado's oil and gas development regulations by expanding the authority of local government/communities over drilling sites. The bill also strives to address concerns about climate change, pollution and threat to wildlife from drilling operations to, while protecting the interests of unwilling mineral rights owners. Finally, the proposal aims to rewrite the mission of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission - the state agency overseeing the energy industry - from economic gain to public safety and environmental protection. Let's debate the pros and cons of the bills. Pro: Backers of the Bill Hail the Health and Safety Provisions Proponents of the measure and environmental groups in particular argue that the passage of the bill is a decisive step toward protecting the Colorado residents' health and safety. Its goal is to ensure that state regulators take profit out of citizen welfare while maintaining the continued development of the local oil and gas industry. Moreover, the bill looks to strengthen local control and address the interests of landowners who refuse to lease their lands to an operator Con: Opponents of the Bill Fear Crippling Blow to the Industry People who are against the bill, along with industry officials, argue that the regulations, if signed into law, would have a devastating economic impact on the entire state. With the Colorado economy depending heavily on oil and gas industry for tax revenues, funds for infrastructure and welfare projects could be hit if local communities go slow on drilling permit approvals within their jurisdiction. They warn that the legislation could potentially lead to job losses and economic hardship. Bill Amended to Allay Apprehensions from Opposition Quarters Seeking to dispel apprehensions that the proposed bill could be misused by state and local bodies leading to outright drilling bans and decelerating industry growth, a number of amendments were added in the past few days. The concessions include a change in language, which aims to ensure that any new regulations/restrictions to be 'necessary and reasonable'. While the revisions were seen by some as adding a degree of certainty, it was not enough to silence dissenters who remain firmly opposed to SB 181. Which Companies Will be Affected? While the bill's passage into law is almost a given considering that Governor Jared Polis is a supporter of the measure himself, it is expected to take many months and public hearings before the rules implementing the law are written. But the Senate Bill 181, which comes after the energy industry defeated 'Proposition 112' - an initiative that would have required new oil and gas wells to be drilled at least 2500 feet from most buildings - is expected to be a real concern for the operators in Colorado. Oil and gas explorers who are exclusively focused on the state's Denver-Julesburg (or, DJ) Basin including HighPoint Resources HPR , Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. BCEI , Extraction Oil & Gas Inc XOG and SRC Energy Inc. SRCI among others, could be in for some rough time. Biggies like Anadarko Petroleum, which has invested heavily in the prolific D-J Basin also stands exposed to an element of uncertainty.

449," Shares of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ: SIVB) fell 10% in March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence , as a flurry of worrying economic signs weighed heavily on the entire banking sector and this Silicon Valley-based lender in particular. March was a bad month for bank stocks. Investors were rattled by the Federal Reserve's unexpected dovish turn that threw future rate hikes into doubt. The losses mounted as the 10-year Treasury bond yields fell below the yields of a three-month Treasury, meaning the yield curve was inverted for the first time since 2007. Investors often view an inverted yield curve as a sign of economic trouble on the horizon.  Image source: Getty Images. SVB was hit harder than most bank stocks, with Bank of America  and JP Morgan Chase , for example, down 5% and 3% for the month, respectively. But shares of SVB also trade at a premium to most bank stocks, priced at 2.4 times book and 13 times trailing earnings compared to Bank of America (1.16 times book, 11.23 times earnings) and JP Morgan (1.5 times book, 11.8 times earnings). SVB has indicated the company does not need the Fed's help in 2019 to boost profitability. The bank has forecasted a net interest margin ( NIM ) of between 3.8% and 3.9% for the year, up from 3.69% in the fourth quarter, without any further Fed action. SVB has long been the preferred bank of the Silicon Valley tech sector, with venture capital fueling the company's 127% year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter . As long as the economy remains stable and the tech sector stays strong, SVB has the ingredients in place to be an outperformer.  10 stocks we like better than SVB Financial Group

451," ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON) recently announced its intention to acquire WiFi technologist Quantenna (NASDAQ: QTNA) , giving the smaller outfit's shareholders a nearly 20% boost from pre-deal announcement prices. With Quantenna's trailing 12-month revenue at just $220 million, the $1 billion price tag looks steep. WiFi hardware is growing, though, and Quantenna is helping lead the charge in making the connectivity tech better. Here's what ON has in mind. Quantenna develops new WiFi solutions, boosting speed and connection reliability and opening up new uses for the technology as the internet continues to evolve. One of Quantenna's capabilities, multi-user MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), may sound familiar; MIMO is one of the core technologies powering new 5G mobile networks , enabling multiple data signals via the same radio channel. The small semiconductor manufacturer also develops software services along with its chips to help its end customers put MIMO WiFi to use. Quantenna's solutions are getting put to use in multiple disciplines like smart-home devices, wireless internet service, and business wireless internet needs. Sales are growing fast, too. 2018 revenue increased 25% over 2017 to $220 million -- including a 52% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter -- and adjusted earnings for the full year were up 104%. In fact, since the stock went public in late 2016, revenue has nearly doubled. That's a big reason why ON settled on Quantenna. ON does think there will be $26 million in annualized synergy between the two operations one year after the deal closes (which is expected to occur during the second half of 2019), but cashing in on the fast-growing high-performance WiFi industry could help ON continue its own pace of expansion (6% revenue and 34% adjusted earnings growth in 2018 ). Plus, given ON's gross profit margin of 38.1% on its $5.88 billion in sales last year, Quantenna's 49.6% gross profit will help pull up ON's gross margin a bit.  Image source: Getty Images. ON doesn't plan to let the Quantenna tech go it alone, though. ON has sizable scale providing power management and Bluetooth chips to automakers, industrial companies, and mobile network providers. WiFi semiconductors will now get added to the mix, and ON thinks it will have cross-selling opportunities from existing customers. That's particularly the case in the auto industry, where electric vehicles and new connectivity options are on the rise. Besides cross-selling, ON also thinks its larger sales channels will also help Quantenna accelerate in the years to come. That's an important point since total MIMO WiFi chipset sales are expected to grow at a 27% annual rate through 2022. The company's total addressable market for WiFi products will double from $2 billion to over $4 billion between now and 2022 as well. Quantenna only musters a small fraction of the overall market now, but plugged into the ON ecosystem, it could benefit from a growing WiFi market and market-share increases. Thus, the $1 billion going price for Quantenna looks expensive right now, but if well executed, it could be a huge growth engine for ON Semiconductor in the years to come.  10 stocks we like better than ON Semiconductor

455," By Sruthi Shankar April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures jumped on Friday as employment growth in March accelerated from a 17-month low, easing concerns of a domestic slowdown, while hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal added to the sentiment. The Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 196,000 jobs last month, above economists' estimate of 180,000. Data for February was revised modestly up to show payrolls rose by 33,000 instead of the previously reported 20,000. The report adds to fairly upbeat construction spending and factory numbers that led Wall Street banks to boost their growth estimates for the first quarter. ""A mixed but overall very solid jobs report. The healthy bounce back in hiring last month should help to quell recession fears,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. ""Still, weaker wage growth suggests the Fed's December rate hike may have been its last in the current cycle."" The Federal Reserve last month suspended its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy, increasing market expectations of an interest rate cut. However, the latest job numbers gave traders little reason to reprice expectations for a rate cut in 2020. Also adding to the upbeat mood was President Donald Trump's comments that the U.S. and China were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks, potentially easing concerns about a months-long tariff war that has clouded global growth. Trade hopes and a dovish Fed have helped push the S&P 500 to its highest since Oct. 9, putting the index less than 2% away from an all-time high of 2,940.91 points.

459," The index notched up another week of strong gains riding on optimism over the increasing likelihood of a near-term U.S.-China trade deal. Multiple reports claimed that the two countries were in the final stages of negotiations with only a few differences remaining. Encouraging manufacturing data also emerged from the United States and China. This went a long way toward dispelling fears of an imminent global economic slowdown. Last Week's Performance The index increased 0.8% last Friday, the last trading day of the first quarter of 2019. Positive developments on the trade war front boosted investor sentiment and overshadowed concerns related to a slowdown in the country's economic growth in the last quarter of 2018. Gains for the 30-stock index were propelled by a rally in shares of Boeing BA , UnitedHealth UNH and Caterpillar CAT , which gained 1.9%, 2.1% and 2.4%, respectively. The Dow gained 1.2% in the past week. After a fabulous February, Wall Street's rally continued in March as well with the Dow gaining 0.1% over last month. Several positive developments on the trade war front, Fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged and consistent performance by technology shares were the major catalysts for U.S. stocks in March. The index surged 11.2% over the first quarter. Eurozone's economic woes and fears related to Brexit weighed on investor sentiment. However, optimism around the trade war, Fed's dovish monetary stance, the end of the government shutdown and stable oil prices were major catalysts behind the stock market rally. Further, stunning fourth-quarter earnings and tech sector's strong performance in the last three months also boosted stocks higher over this period. Dow This Week The index gained 1.3% on Monday after investor sentiment was boosted by healthy manufacturing data from the United States and China. Further, China also announced that it would continue to reduce additional tariffs on U.S. autos in order to aid trade negotiations. Meanwhile, Dow finished above the 26,000 level for the first time in more than a month. The index lost 0.3% on Tuesday as investors digested weak earnings results and unimpressive economic data.

The index gained 166.50 points or 0.6% on Thursday as investors eagerly awaited the outcome of the current round of U.S.-China trade negotiations. According to multiple reports, talks between the two countries have entered their final stage. Gains for the Dow were primarily propelled by a 2.9% increase in shares of Boeing. The aircraft maker notched up such gains after unveiling a fresh software patch for its troubled 737 Max aircraft. Shares of DowDuPont DWDP increased 1.2%.

461," By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - The dollar fell slightly on Friday after a jobs report for March showed than U.S. job gains were better than expected during the month while wage pressures were muted. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 196,000 jobs last month. Data for February was revised modestly up to show payrolls rising by 33,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 20,000. February job gains were the smallest since September 2017. ""It's a pretty mixed report. The headline was a little bit better than expected, February was revised up slightly, but obviously the average hourly earnings was a big disappointment,"" said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Reaction in the dollar was relatively muted, and swung between small gains and losses. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was last down 0.06% on the day at 97.256. Investors are focused on data for further clues about Federal Reserve policy after the U.S. central bank stunned markets in March by abandoning projections for any interest rate hikes this year. ""The takeaway for me is that it basically means steady as she goes,"" said Thin.

463," In this episode of MarketFoolery , host Chris Hill and analyst Emily Flippen analyze today's market winners and losers. GameStop (NYSE: GME) , down 5% on earnings, has blown through some four CEOs in the last year, and that's not even touching its (complete lack of a) business model. On the other hand, Dave & Buster's Entertainment (NASDAQ: PLAY) seems to have figured out how to turn a profit from video games, and recent changes are paying off big. The Food and Drug Administration plans to weigh in on cannabidiol (CBD) edibles this May, and the changes could be huge for CBD producers at every point on the sketchiness spectrum. Tune in to find out more. A full transcript follows the video.   10 stocks we like better than Walmart
When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of January 31, 2019
The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.  This video was recorded on April 3, 2019. Chris Hill: It's Wednesday, April 3rd. Welcome to MarketFoolery ! I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio, it's Emily Flippen. Thanks for being here! Emily Flippen: Thanks for having me again, Chris! Hill: We've got some earnings we're going to get to. We're going to dip into the Fool mailbag. We're going to get to one of your areas of expertise. I know you have many areas of expertise, but we're going to get to one with the growing trend of cannabis legalization. We'll get to all of that. Unfortunately, we're going to start with GameStop. It was a rough fourth quarter for GameStop. Even worse, the video game retailer warned that there's probably going to be a loss in the first quarter, the current quarter that we're in right now. Shares down 5%. I'm looking for a silver lining with GameStop, and I can't find one. Flippen: I should have told you this before I came on, Chris, but you could not have picked a worst analyst to come on give commentary about GameStop. I've had a long and complicated relationship with GameStop. Hill: Do tell! Flippen:  Well, GameStop has been a terrible investment! But in my opinion, it's a terrible investment because management has always made terrible decisions. For a while, I was a big believer -- and in a sense, still am -- in GameStop's ability to change its business model for the better; to make it something that exists in five or 10 years. That hedged on, GameStop has this amazing refurbishment facility out in Texas. They're the only people really capable of buying, refurbishing, selling games. And they've never really tried to do anything with it. It was always this back-of-their-mind business model. So, for me, it's a frustrating stock to look at. At this point, there's really no saving GameStop. It's definitely down and out at this point. I'm not sure if there's a silver lining purely because management -- by the way, they're getting a new CEO in April, but the CEOs turned over a ton. They just have no vision. They're just sitting there, getting the dividend, wringing out the company for what it's worth then moving on. Hill: We've talked on this show before about executive turnover at Tesla . Executive meaning the executive suite. In some ways, that pales in comparison to GameStop. This is going to be their fifth CEO in just over a year. That's going to be so depressing for so many people who work at that company! Flippen: It's clear that the company has no vision. I joked talking about GameStop earlier today with Aaron Bush. I made the joke that at least with Sears, Eddie Lampert had a plan. Hill: [laughs] It was not a great plan! Flippen: Not a plan to return value to shareholders. But man, did he have a plan to return value to himself, and he did it! And at least there was an underlying goal with that company. With GameStop, it's clear, they're just flailing, and they've been flailing for a long time. Hill: We'll keep an eye on it, but we're going to move on. On the flip side, Dave & Buster's had a pretty solid fourth quarter. Same-store sales came in higher than expected. Shares of Dave & Buster's up about 4% or 5% this morning. They look like they are doing a very good job of not only just operating well quarter after quarter, but also not really sitting on their hands. Flippen: Yeah, definitely. They've been expanding aggressively. They've done a great job marketing this reformed Dave & Buster's, where it's a trendy, fun spot for adults to hang out after work or on the weekends. Been running a ton of promotions, including happy hours and food specials. Trimming down the business model to make it look sleeker and more exciting. Changing up the amusements to be more modern and high-tech. They're actually doing an impressive job. I will say that the company, while it beat on this quarter, they still expect same-store sales to be flat to the range of 0% to 1.5% over the next fiscal 2019. That to me is a little bit concerning, especially because you see this pop today, but ultimately, net income, while it beat expectations, it's still down 17% year over year. It's not like this is a really high-growth business. But they're definitely taking steps to change the brand and change the awareness of the company. Hill: Yeah. Some would, in the years past, derisively refer to this as Chuck E. Cheese for adults. To your point, they're doing a good job of refreshing the games that they have. They're also doing a good job of slimming down their menu and just saying, ""We just need to have enough food and make it be good enough."" They're doing a good job with the menu. The food menu is being slimmed down. They're doing a good job with their drink promotions. Think what you want about that, but that's a profit part of the business for them. So it seems like they're doing well on the operating level. Did you get a sense of any plans they have for expansion? I forget the company we were talking about, some retailer, last week. Maybe it was Five Below . I was really surprised by how many new locations Five Below is planning in this calendar year. Do you have a sense of what Dave & Buster's [is planning]? Among other things, management at Dave & Buster's has struck me as being pretty smart about not being overly aggressive in opening new locations. Flippen: Yeah, they're definitely not being as aggressive as someone like Five Below is. But, that's largely because Dave & Buster's already has a huge footprint. They are still expanding, though. They're net expanding. You mentioned the food. I know we're going to touch on this a little bit later, but they're doing a good job of staying trendy with their menu. One of the foods that they're bringing on is actually the Impossible Burger, a meat alternative burger. They're now offering that at their locations, as part of that slimmed-down menu. It's going to be a fun company to watch. I'm not really sold at this point, though. Hill: The Food and Drug Administration announced its first public hearing on legalizing CBD in food and drinks. Speaking of food and beverages. That's going to be on May 31st. We had talked last week about CVS and then Walgreens starting to sell CBD lotions, topical cannabis products, in their stores. This will certainly be an interesting hearing to watch unfold. When you look at this in your role, not just as an analyst but as co-advisor of one of our marijuana investing services, who stands to benefit from this? Flippen: There's a lot of companies that both stand to benefit and lose from the potential outcomes of this hearing. To be clear, a lot of people who are interested in this space don't necessarily spend all their day researching the industry like the analysts here do. Hill: Right. The listeners have jobs. Flippen: [laughs] Exactly! Hill: They're going to school, they have jobs. They're like, ""No, that's why I listen to you people."" Flippen: So, to clarify the difference between cannabis and CBD and THC. CBD is derived from the hemp part of cannabis, which was legalized in December. However, you'll see CVS, Walgreens, they're selling CBD products, but they're topical products. They don't have to go through the FDA to get approval. Anything that involves CBD that's being sold as a dietary supplement, that's what's affected by this upcoming hearing. Right now, virtually every company that's selling CBD is violating FDA orders by selling it as a dietary supplement. They haven't been very proactive in going after these companies unless they've been the companies that are making extremely egregious claims -- like that CBD will cure cancer or Alzheimer's. Those are the companies they're going after. But for basic companies that are just selling CBD oil and saying, ""It's a dietary supplement, order online!"" the FDA is acknowledging, ""Hey, you're outside the bounds. We're not going to go up against you, but we are going to put a hearing on and determine whether or not CBD, A. should be sold as a dietary supplement; and B. should be sold in food and drinks."" At the moment, you can't put CBD in any sort of edible or drinkable product. It's interesting, CBD is acting in this space where it's both a drug, because there is a CBD-based drug that has been FDA approved for epilepsy, and also acting as a dietary supplement. Those two things are naturally against each other. You're not going to be able to go and buy a controlled substances off the shelves of your local grocery store. The FDA has a big job ahead of them, determining how they're going to handle CBD if it's both a drug, but also being used as a dietary supplement. Hill: Depending on the outcome of this hearing, do you expect to see another wave of investment, in the same way that last year we saw large companies, whether it was Altria , Coca-Cola , Pepsi , either making direct investments, or at leas t report edly looking into investments? Should we expect some other wave coming depending on the outcome of this? Flippen: Yes, for sure. I'm a big fan of making unsubstantiated claims. [laughs] I really do believe that the FDA is going to give approval for CBD to be used once it's proven safe and effective in things like food and drinks. I fully expect, once the FDA has given that final stamp of approval, we're going to see a huge wave of investment into CBD, which is why I said I think companies stand to both benefit from it and lose from it. If you're one of the companies that's making these egregious claims, yeah, they're going to crack down on you. But if you're one of the companies that's selling your products maybe a little bit under the table, admittedly, at this time, once you get that approval, it opens up so many doors. Hill: E-mail from Steve Jenkins, who writes, ""I'm using my Grammarly Premium subscription to write this impactful email to tell you how much I enjoyed the April Fool's MarketFoolery podcast. The unbelievable podcast was made that much more believable by Taylor Muckerman's constant approving and reinforcing ""hmmms"" throughout the back-and-forth with Jason Moser. Standardized street signs with advertising. Really? April Fool on, guys."" Thank you for that, Steve! Thank you to everyone who's written in or tweeted at us about the joke! I was telling someone on Monday about what we did on the episode. He said, ""Do you think anyone's going to be fooled?"" And I said, ""Here's the thing. When people listen to podcasts, a lot of people are multitasking. They're driving, they're doing stuff around the house. If part of your brain is on something else, then yeah, you might get sucked in."" And, in fact, that happened to me. Monday night, I was at home, listening to Pardon the Interruption , the PTI podcast. I was doing some dinner prep. Their lead story was about Zion Williamson, the star basketball player for Duke. They were talking about, ""Hey, Zion Williamson, reports are, he's not going to go pro. He's not going to the NBA. He's going back to Duke because he doesn't like the prospects of the team he's going to be going to."" And I was sitting there, chopping some vegetables, thinking, ""Boy, that's a little surprising, but it's not that surprising."" They totally got me! Flippen: You fell for it! Hill: Totally fell for it! You mentioned the Impossible Burgers, which leads me to Burger King. I'm sure someone has written about this, and I just haven't found it yet. On April 1st, Burger King announced it is testing a new burger called the Impossible Whopper. And people thought it was a joke because it was April 1st. No, this is not a joke. These are veggie burgers made by a company called Impossible Foods. Burger King is testing it at around 60 locations in the St. Louis area. For any of the dozens of listeners who are in the St. Louis area who want to test that out for us, do a little boots-on-the-ground research, we'd appreciate it. You can email us, marketfoolery@foo.com . You said you've tried these before. Not the Whoppers because you haven't been to St. Louis lately, but you've tried these. Flippen: I have. I've tried the Beyond Meat burger. That's a company that makes a competing burger. It's coming up for an IPO this year. I'm actually trying the Impossible Burger with a friend on Friday. Very, very few times have I been upset that The Motley Fool is based out of Alexandria, Virginia, but today is one of those days because, man, I wish I was in St. Louis! I want to try this Impossible Whopper. Unfortunately, I'm limited to the restaurants around this area that sell it, which of course is going to lead to me paying $15 for a meatless burger just to give it a try. Hill: So, again, if someone could do a little research for us, let us know, in part because now we know it's going to really bum Emily out that you got to try it and she didn't. Beyond Meat's going public later this year. Do we have timing on that IPO? Is that in the first half of this year, as a lot of other companies seem to be moving up there IPOs? Or have they not put a date on it? Flippen: To the best of my knowledge, there's not a date on it. They've had the prospectus out since November. It's been on the table for a while now. I think they' actually might be going through some legal issues, which has pushed that back a bit. It's definitely going to be an exciting one to watch. Not only is it a new product. Impossible Burger is a competitor to them. They do similar things with different methodologies. Nobody knows how large the industry could be for meatless burgers. If they're able to produce ground meat that tastes like ground meat, is at the same price point as ground meat, nobody knows how many people are going to start switching over to this meatless alternative. I know personally I would. But it's TBD whether or not that ends up being a quick fad or a long-term trend. Hill: I have to believe that, even though it's not Beyond Meat who has this arrangement with Burger King, at least some of the people in the executive offices at Beyond Meat have to be happy that this is happening. It raises the profile for this type of industry to make it even more viable. Flippen: Exactly. Actually, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have gone in two different directions. While both are selling to stores, Impossible Burger has spent a lot more time getting stores to start selling their burger where you go out to eat -- restaurants, retail locations. Beyond Meat is much more focused on grocery stores. They want the local consumer to go out and buy a meatless sausage, buy a meatless patty, and cook it themselves. That's not to say that they don't have operations with food chains. They do. But the focus of the two companies has been somewhat different. So, I agree. I think that this is just going to push toward a long-term trend of accepting meatless alternatives. Hill: Emily Flippen, always good talking to you! Thanks for being here!

464," Have you been paying attention to shares of Ingersoll-Rand PLC (IR)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7.6% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $112.57 in the previous session. Ingersoll-Rand PLC has gained 23.1% since the start of the year compared to the 19.1% move for the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the 23.9% return for the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry. What's Driving the Outperformance? The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its las t earnings report on January 30, 2019, Ingersoll-Rand reported EPS of $1.32 versus consensus estimate of $1.28 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.3%. For the current fiscal year, Ingersoll-Rand is expected to post earnings of $6.29 per share on $16.42 billion in revenues. This represents a 12.12% change in EPS on a 4.79% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.97 per share on $17.1 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.79% and 4.13%, respectively. Valuation Metrics Ingersoll-Rand may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself. On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style. Ingersoll-Rand has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B. In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 15.6X versus its peer group's average of 12.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.72. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. Zacks Rank We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Ingersoll-Rand currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates. Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Ingersoll-Rand fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Ingersoll-Rand shares could still be poised for more gains ahead. How Does Ingersoll-Rand Stack Up to the Competition? Shares of Ingersoll-Rand have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Metso (MXCYY), DXP Enterprises (DXPE), and Tennant (TNC), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices. However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Ingersoll-Rand. Still, the fundamentals for Ingersoll-Rand are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.",24.17999999999938,1

KLA-Tencor has gained 38.6% since the start of the year compared to the 20.1% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 31.5% return for the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry. What's Driving the Outperformance? The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its las t earnings report on January 29, 2019, KLA-Tencor reported EPS of $2.44 versus consensus estimate of $2.2 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4.49%. For the current fiscal year, KLA-Tencor is expected to post earnings of $8.43 per share on $4.52 billion in revenues. This represents a 5.38% change in EPS on a 11.86% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $9.39 per share on $5.27 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.33% and 16.68%, respectively.

467," ZURICH, April 5 (Reuters) - The Swiss government proposed on Friday tightening capital requirements for big banks that could prompt UBS and Credit Suisse to issue up to a combined 24 billion Swiss francs ($24 billion) worth of bail-in bonds. The draft proposal was put out for comment by the finance ministry until July 12. ""The additional requirements for funds ... amounts to some 24 billion Swiss francs for the two big banks,"" the draft proposal said, noting UBS and Credit Suisse would gradually have to issue this amount of additional bail-in bonds at the holding level. UBS and Credit Suisse had no immediate comment on the plan, which still has to be finalised and approved by parliament. The proposal comes amid international efforts to ensure banks have enough capital to withstand losses amid market turbulence without state aid. UBS and Credit Suisse have operated under so-called ""gone concern"" rules since 2016, with scaled-down requirements for other big lenders PostFinance, Raiffeisen and ZKB since this year. The draft released on Friday also suggests tightening capital requirements for loans that finance investments in Swiss residential property amid concerns that the sector is overheating given ultra-low Swiss interest rates. But it suggests the government forego changes should banks come up with a self-regulation approach that wins approval from the FINMA watchdog.  ($1 = 1.0003 Swiss francs) ",24.17999999999938,1
468,"After a brief pullback, Gold is losing ground following a mixed employmen t report in the United States. DXY reacted positively as the market saw Nonfarm payrolls numbers as a positive signal that the US economy is in good shape. The United States employment report showed that 196K new jobs were created in March, better than the 180K nonfarm payrolls expected by the market. February was revised 13K up to 33K. The unemployment rate remains at 3.8%, but the participation rate declined to 63.0% from 63.2%, even though expectations were for a more significant decline to 62.9%. Wages disappointed with a 3.2% monthly increase only, below the 3.4% expected by the market and performed previous month. Watch the long term picture The Payroll number of 196K new jobs in March cuts down concerns that the labor market in the US might be weakening following February's 20K reading and March ADP data of 129K. Wage growth was disappointing, but it will have a minimal impact on the long term market sentiment as overall job creation remains strong and the lack of labor supply will push wages higher in the long term. Finally, annual wage increases stay in a positive trend. In this framework, equities remain strong, and the dollar index is adding gains with the gold becoming under pressure. XAU/USD is approaching to recent lows. After a brief shakeup, dollar is trading positive on the day as investors are welcoming nonfarm payrolls data. DXY is currently trading at 97.32, 0.02% positive on the day after a brief peak to intra-day highs at 97.40. Gold is trading negative on Friday following the nonfarm payrolls, but it remains inside the recent range between 1,285 and 1,295. Currently, XAU/USD is pricing at 1,290, 0.15% negative on the day. The pair is under pressure following the employment data, but the movement doesn't seem too violent to be the catalyst that will drive the metal below its critical 1,280 support. Gold is ready to close its second negative week in a row, but as mentioned above, 1,280 seems strong enough. As James Hyerczyk, FX Empire analyst said in a recent article , ""gold futures are being pressured by a stronger U.S. Dollar, rising interest rates and increasing appetite for higher risk assets."" Silver is trading positive on Friday after a brief pullback on the US nonfarm payrolls data. The metal is extending its bounce from 14.90 performed on Thursday. XAG/USD is currently trading at 15.18, 0.22% positive on the day. Silver is now testing the 15.20 significant resistance that has limited gains in the last five sessions. The metal is poised to close positive on the week after the significant loss performed the last period. However, the commodity looks vulnerable in the bigger picture.

470," Video-game niche retailer GameStop (NYSE: GME) delivered the news on its holiday quarter Wednesday, and happy, it was not. But worse was its guidance for a loss in the current quarter. In this segment of the MarketFoolery podcast, senior analyst Emily Flippen tells host Chris Hill what pains her the most about this company's long, ugly decline -- because she feels it was not inevitable. It's just a sad tale, she says, of missed opportunities and a lack of vision. A full transcript follows the video.   10 stocks we like better than GameStop
When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and GameStop wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of March 1, 2019 This video was recorded on April 3, 2019. Chris Hill: It was a rough fourth quarter for GameStop. Even worse, the video game retailer warned that there's probably going to be a loss in the first quarter, the current quarter that we're in right now. Shares down 5%. I'm looking for a silver lining with GameStop, and I can't find one. Emily Flippen: I should have told you this before I came on, Chris, but you could not have picked a worst analyst to come on and give commentary about GameStop, because I've had a long and complicated relationship with GameStop. Hill: Do tell! Flippen: Well, GameStop has been a terrible investment! But in my opinion, it's a terrible investment because management has always made terrible decisions. For a while, I was a big believer -- and in a sense, still am -- in GameStop's ability to change its business model for the better; to make it something that exists in five or 10 years. That hedged on, GameStop has this amazing refurbishment facility out in Texas. They're the only people really capable of buying, refurbishing, selling games. And they've never really tried to do anything with it. It was always this back-of-their-mind business model. So, for me, it's a frustrating stock to look at, because at this point, there's really no saving GameStop. It's definitely down and out at this point. I'm not sure if there's a silver lining purely because management -- by the way, they're getting a new CEO in April, but the CEOs turned over a ton -- they just have no vision. They're just sitting there, getting their dividends, wringing out the company for what it's worth, then moving on. Hill: We've talked on this show before about executive turnover at Tesla . Executive meaning the executive suite. In some ways, that pales in comparison to GameStop. This is going to be their fifth CEO in just over a year. That's going to be so depressing for so many people who work at that company! Flippen: It's clear that the company has no vision. I joked talking about GameStop earlier today with Aaron Bush. I made the joke that at least Sears and Eddie Lampert, he had a plan. Hill: [laughs] It was not a great plan! Flippen: Not a plan to return value to shareholders. But man, did he have a plan to return value to himself, and he did it! And at least there was an underlying goal with that company. With GameStop, it's clear, they're just flailing, and they've been flailing for a long time. Hill: We'll keep an eye on it. Chris Hill has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Emily Flippen has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Tesla. The Motley Fool owns shares of GameStop and has the following options: short April 2019 $13 calls on GameStop. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .",24.17999999999938,1

472," Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks. Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels. Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today. One company value investors might notice is Walker & Dunlop (WD). WD is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. Investors should also recognize that WD has a P/B ratio of 1.77. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.15. Within the past 52 weeks, WD's P/B has been as high as 2.28 and as low as 1.32, with a median of 1.91. Finally, we should also recognize that WD has a P/CF ratio of 5.29. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. WD's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 13.72. WD's P/CF has been as high as 5.93 and as low as 3.47, with a median of 5.10, all within the past year. These are only a few of the key metrics included in Walker & Dunlop's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, WD looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.",24.17999999999938,1

Over the past 52 weeks, VSH's PEG has been as high as 2.67 and as low as 0.83, with a median of 1.10. We should also highlight that VSH has a P/B ratio of 1.99.

Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. VSH has a P/S ratio of 0.96. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.17. Finally, we should also recognize that VSH has a P/CF ratio of 5.46. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook.

DAL's Forward P/E has been as high as 9.85 and as low as 7.16, with a median of 8.38, all within the past year. Another valuation metric that we should highlight is DAL's P/B ratio of 2.62. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.83. Over the past 12 months, DAL's P/B has been as high as 3.21 and as low as 2.29, with a median of 2.81. Finally, investors will want to recognize that DAL has a P/CF ratio of 5.69. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 6.33. Over the past year, DAL's P/CF has been as high as 7.89 and as low as 4.97, with a median of 6.89. These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Delta Air Lines is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, DAL feels like a great value stock at the moment.",24.17999999999938,1

BHC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 6.29, which compares to its industry's average of 8.32. Over the past 52 weeks, BHC's Forward P/E has been as high as 8.78 and as low as 4.59, with a median of 6.33. Investors will also notice that BHC has a PEG ratio of 0.59. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. BHC's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.24. BHC's PEG has been as high as 0.59 and as low as 0.23, with a median of 0.33, all within the past year. These are only a few of the key metrics included in Bausch Health's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, BHC looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.",24.17999999999938,1

484,"   For Immediate Release Chicago, IL -April 5, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. LX , JD.com, Inc. JD , CNOOC Limited CEO , OneSmart International Education Group Ltd. ONE and Yirendai Ltd. YRD . Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog: China Stocks Shatter 1-Year High: 5 Top Picks On Apr 4, equities in China breached their highest level in a year. Additionally, the blue-chip CSI 300 Index posted its fourth consecutive weekly advance. Gains for the trading session and the week were largely attributable to rising optimism over a near-term U.S.-China trade deal. Reports have emerged that the two countries are extremely close to sealing an agreement. Meanwhile, fresh evidence has emerged that the Chinese government's stimulus measures are making an impact. Official and private indexes of manufacturing and services have shown significant improvement. It is also extremely likely that authorities will take further steps to boost China's sluggish economy. This is why market watchers at large think that this is a great time to invest in China stocks. Optimism Over Trade Deal Rises According to a Financial Times report on Apr 3, the United States and China have managed to settle most of their differences on trade issues. Only a few areas of divergence remain, per Myron Brilliant, executive vice president for international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. According to him, trade negotiations are ""getting into the end-game stage."" Brilliant added: ""Ninety percent of the deal is done."" He claimed that a few sticking points remain, which could prove difficult to resolve. Apparently, China wants the United States to suspend all tariffs currently in place. However, the Trump administration is not very excited about the idea since it wishes to retain an enforcement mechanism even after a deal is struck. According to the Financial Times, if a deal proves elusive even after the current round of talks concludes in Washington, the next round of talks could be held in June at the G-20 meet in Japan. But such an unfavorable outcome to the current round of talks seems unlikely with Trump's economic adviser Larry Kudlow claiming on Apr 2 that both countries ""expect to make more headway."" Kudlow added that there is a ""certain amount of optimism"" about this round of discussions. Economic Metrics Improve, Additional Stimulus Likely In March, China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) increased from 49.9 in February to 50.8 in March. The expansion was the fastest pace witnessed in eight months. The report comes on the heels of Apr 31's official figures, which also indicate that China's manufacturing sector improved in March. The official Purchasing Managers' Index recovered from February's three-year low of 49.2 to hit to 50.5 in March. This marks the first expansion in four months. (Read: ISM Manufacturing Index Rebounds From 2-Year Low: 5 Top Picks ) Further signs of a recovery were visible on Apr 3, with the Caixin China services purchasing managers index touching a 14-month high in March. This is a clear indication that government stimulus measures are having their desired effect. Meanwhile, analysts believe that China's central bank will reduce cash reserve requirements soon to boost liquidity and consequently the country's economy. Additionally, state media said on Apr 3 that the government will reduce fees and service charges in order to lower costs for individuals and companies. Our Choices Fresh optimism over a near-term trade deal is propelling Chinese equities to new record levels. Additionally, enough economic evidence is now available to suggest that the government's stimulus measures are having an impact. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the Shanghai Composite and the CSI 300 are up 30.2% and 34.9%, respectively, year to date and are likely to rise further. Investing in Chinese stocks looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult. This is where our VGM Score comes in.

485," Reportedly, Apple AAPL has slashed HomePod prices by almost 15%, globally. Per 9 to 5 Mac, the smart speaker is now available at $299 (down $50) in the United States. The firm believes solid demand for smart speakers in China, where Amazon and Google do not have a presence, benefited Alibaba, Baidu and Xiaomi, pushing the companies to the top six. However, Apple's market share had declined.

Price Cut to Help Apple Gain Market Share

Apple has failed to gain a strong foothold in the smart-speaker market owing to its late entry and hefty price point. While HomePoad was launched last February, Alibaba's Tmall Genie, Xiaomi's Mi AI Speaker and Amazon Echo were rolled out in 2017. Google Home was introduced to the market in November 2016.

Moreover, HomePod's price tag was heftier than Echo and Google Home, available at $99 and $130, respectively. Further, Google and Amazon have lower-cost devices like Google Home Mini and Amazon Echo Dot, both of which are priced at $49. One-Year Price Performance  Although Apple's latest price cut doesn't close the gap much against these devices, it can be effective in aiding HomePod's popularity.

HomePod dominates the premium market (above $250) and its superior sound quality is praiseworthy. Notably, Google's Home Max is a device in the same category ($399).

Apple also scores better with its regional language support in China, which the other two behemoths, Amazon and Google, apparently lack.

Apple is now rumored to launch HomePod 2. It is also speculated    that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock will integrate Face ID with a new HomePod. Apple may also launch a smaller and cheaper version of HomePod, per Macworld.

Amazon Racing Away, Google Keeping Pace

The emergence of virtual assistants embedded with AI techniques continues to fuel the demand for smart speakers. Rapid proliferation of virtual assistants and improving AI skills are aiding these speakers to become more advanced with each passing day. This is likely to boost the adoption rate of smart speakers further in every possible sectors starting from residential homes, smart offices, automobiles to hospitals.

Both Amazon and Google are benefiting from this trend. Although Amazon still dominates the smart-speaker market, Google is narrowing the gap, as reflected by the below chart from Canalys.  Amazon's efforts to expand features of Echo devices, improving Alexa skills and affordability are key catalysts. Alexa Skills Store offers more than 80,000 skills. Furthermore, customers can now access Apple Music's library of 50 million songs on their Echo devices.

Amazon is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it's safe to say that it has taken an early lead over Google's smart assistant and Microsoft Cortana.

Nevertheless, Google's continued efforts to keep pace with Echo devices by partnering smart-home gadget makers, as well as improving AI techniques, which are expanding Google Assistant's skills, are notable.

While Google parent Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3, at present, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .

486," Shopify (NYSE: SHOP)  came under fire on Thursday following another scathing Citron Research report. The skewering cost the stock 5% of its value on Thursday -- sending the shares back below $200 -- but that also may have been a dinner bell for an opportunistic bull. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian is boosting his price target on the shares from $188 to $208. Sebastian feels that Shopify's clear leadership in its niche will help it stand out in this increasingly competitive environment. Between encouraging secular e-commerce trends and Shopify's potential for incremental growth as it expands its reach and service offerings, it's not a surprise that Sebastian is sticking to his bullish outperform rating on the stock.  Image source: Shopify. Shopify stock has come a long way in a short amount of time, something that may seem evident when you consider that a bull for the dot-com speedster had a $188 price goal on the shares until Thursday afternoon. The stock has traded well above that mark for nearly a month. The stock has been one of this year's bigger gainers, up 41% in 2019 including Thursday's swoon. As volatile as Shopify might be, it has moved at least 38% higher in each of its first five calendar years since going public. Betting against Shopify has been dangerous. Sebastian's move of dealing with an appreciating Shopify by lifting his price target instead of lowering its rating has been par for the course here. Last week, it was Gus Papageorgiou at Macquarie jacking up his finish line from $204 to $230. His move matched the Street high set by RBC Capital in February. The bulls are in agreement that Shopify is in a great position to gain wider adoption for more of its related services. Shopify's growth -- while decelerating every quarter over the past three years -- is still impressive. Revenue rose a better-than-expected 54% in its latest quarter , and trailing revenue now tops $1 billion. The business will continue to slow at this point. Analysts see revenue decelerating to a 39% ascent this year and again to 32% top-line growth come 2020. This isn't a deal breaker, as the stock has moved higher in each of the past three years despite the revenue deceleration. Shopify likes to move, but perhaps more importantly, bullish analysts like to make sure that they don't get left behind.

487," Following a dreadful 2018, chipmakers are hot again on encouraging trade talks and a rebound in China's manufacturing activity. Adding to the optimism is industry rationalization and slew of new technological trends like Internet of Things, high-end gaming and 5G wireless. At the same time, reports of smartphone market recovery are taking chip stocks higher. Given the bullishness, investing in solid semiconductor stocks seems like a foolproof plan. Trade Optimism, Stronger China Economy The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, the benchmark for chipmakers, took a beating last year amid rising trade tensions between the United States and China. Also, Beijing's weak economy was a serious headache for chipmakers as it could dent demand for semiconductor components. But, such worries have now ebbed significantly. This year, the index outpaced the broader S&P 500 on progress in U.S.-China trade talks and better-than-expected manufacturing numbers from the world's second-largest economy. Both the U.S. and Chinese trade officials have begun talks to bring an end to their prolonged trade dispute. Myron Brilliant, executive vice-president of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, recently said that ""ninety percent of the deal is done, but the last 10% is the hardest part, it's the trickiest part and it will require trade-offs on both sides."" Nonetheless, resolving most of the differences is a reassuring sign for chipmakers as they are heavily dependent on China for revenues. China's growth concerns, by the way, have dissipated to a great extent. China's official Purchasing Managers Index made a stellar comeback in March, rising to a six-month high of 50.5 from 49.2 in February. Beijing took adequate steps like tax cutting to stimulate manufacturing activities. Encouraging Prospects The prospects of chipmakers have improved substantially this year on initiatives to improve efficiency. In the DRAM market, the number of producers has now consolidated to just three - Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc. MU . This structural change has improved efficiency and raised profit margins. Equipment makers such as Lam Research Corporation LRCX are also producing chips of their own design. Such chips are much in demand from aircraft manufacturers to cloud computing behemoths like Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN . From high-end gaming, emergence of Internet of Things to automation, demand for chips continues to rise. Needless to say, e-sport, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, needs thousands of semiconductor chips for production, while chips are an essential part of crypto mining as these provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms. As long as investors continue to be bullish on the prospects of fifth generation of wireless connectivity or 5G, it is widely anticipated that demand for chips will improve. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited's TSM , in the meantime, has signaled that smartphone orders are picking up in Asia. Taiwan Semiconductor will ramp up its 7 nanometer production rates due to an uptick in orders for Android devices. Thus, Taiwan Semiconductor is particularly expected to witness a strong second quarter of 2019. Others such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA have also predicted a recovery in the second half. To top it, NVIDIA's nearly $7 billion purchase of Israeli chip designer Mellanox helped renew investors' faith on the beaten-down sector. This is Nvidia's biggest deal which has also strengthened its hold in the growing data center market.  5 Solid Choices Banking on the strength, chipmakers are positioned to gain in the near term. We have, thus, short-listed five stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Xilinx, Inc. XLNX designs and develops programmable devices and associated technologies worldwide.

488," Wall Street is raging forward for the last 10 years, withstanding intermittent volatilities and fluctuations. After completing a record-setting first quarter of 2019, stock markets are heading further northward in April. The bull run has helped the three main stock indexes -- the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite -- to reach close to record-high levels. Likelihood of U.S.-China Trade Deal

Since the beginning of 2019, both United States and China are negotiating earnestly to find out an amicable solution to the trade spat. After a successful round of negotiation in Beijing between high-level delegations of two sides, the second round of talk has completed in Washington this week.

On Apr 4, President Trump said ""we'll know over the next four weeks'' if a deal with China happens, after expressing his views that the negotiation is moving forward in the right direction. On Apr 5, Xinhua reported that Chinese vice premier Liu He said a new consensus has been reached between the two countries on an important issue of trade agreement that they are negotiating.

On Mar 27, Reuters reported that China has made unprecedented proposals on a host of issues, including the protection of U.S. intellectual properties to resolve the trade disputes.

Statista validates that the U.S. cardiovascular devices market is expected to reach a worth of $15.7 billion by 2021. Thus, the latest development has been a well-timed one for ABIOMED.  Price Performance We believe positive developments such as these would drive the shares of ABIOMED which have declined 3.2% against the industry 's 13.6% rally in a year's time.

490," There is a general belief that shying away from risky stocks will keep returns at bay. However, this stands true only when the market is bullish. Since risky securities are mostly exposed to market volatility, we have created a strategy to fetch handsome returns from less-risky stocks. Meaning of Beta Beta indicates the volatility of a particular stock with respect to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of stock price movement relative to the market (we are considering S&P 500 here). If a company has a beta of 1, it means that the relative volatility of the stock is the same as that of the S&P 500. In the same way, if the stock's beta is greater than 1 then it is more volatile compared to the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 signifies less volatility. Now, if a portfolio's beta is 3, it is three times more volatile than the market. Hence, if the market is projected to give 20% return, the portfolio will then definitely contribute 60% return which is amazing. However, the opposite case also holds true. If the market slips 20% then the portfolio return plummets 60% which is surely a matter of concern. The Winning Strategy In our screening criteria we included  beta in the range of 0 to 0.6  for short listing low risk stocks. But this can't be the only criterion for betting on stocks. The other parameters that need to be added to create a winning portfolio are: Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero: This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month. Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable. Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher. Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. Here are five of the seven stocks that qualified the screening: lululemon athletica inc. LULU , based in Vancouver, Canada, is a provider of athletic apparel.

He delivered a message to Trump from Chinese President Xi Jinping to the effect substantial progress has been made and he hopes a quick resolution can be reached. President Trump says they are making swift progress and a deal is possible within the next four weeks. European equities were flat and mixed at midday as traders digest the latest trade news. The good news is that both sides are positive on progress, the bad news is the timing of the deal has been pushed back another two weeks. The DAX was trading the weakest, hovering near 0.0%, while the other major indices were up about 0.25%. Basic resources led the gains with an advance of 0.50%. The sector has extensive exposure to China and is sensitive to trade news. Growth concerns are weighing on sentiment despite the trade news and U.S. labor data.

492," Shares in The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) declined 13.3% in March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence . The aviation giant's stock lost value in the aftermath of the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, the second time in the last six months that a Boeing 737 MAX plane has suffered a tragedy. In addition, the Ethiopian Airlines crash and October's Lion Air crash appear to have strong similarities. In both cases, it's believed that erroneous data from so-called angle of attack (AOA) sensors triggered a computer controlled system -- known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS -- to lower the nose and cause the plane to dive.  Travelers need to feel confident in the Boeing 737 MAX. Image source: Getty Images. As a consequence, Boeing has stopped delivery of all new 737 MAX jets,  and the planes already in service have been grounded. There will obviously be a financial impact on Boeing from recent events, but it's far from clear at this stage what it's going to be. The key question is whether there will be a long-term drop in future and existing orders if airlines and the public lose confidence in the 737 MAX. Alongside the Airbus A320 family, the Boeing 737 MAX (an upgrade to the existing 737) is intended to be the workhorse of the commercial aviation industry . It's a crucial part of Boeing's future. Much will depend on the ongoing investigations into the crashes and the Federal Aviation Administration's review of the 737 MAX. CEO Dennis Muilenburg is assuring travelers that the company is working on a software update that ""along with the associated training and additional educational materials that pilots want in the wake of these accidents, will eliminate the possibility of unintended MCAS activation and prevent an MCAS-related accident from ever happening again."" He went on to state that an update was nearing completion and he anticipated ""certification and implementation"" in the next few weeks. We also know that erroneous AOA sensor data caused a similar issue on a Lufthansa flight in 2014 on an Airbus plane. Fortunately, the Lufthansa pilots were able to react in time. Appropriate action and training took place in the aftermath of the event, and Airbus didn't suffer long-term financial harm. Boeing and aviation authorities appear committed to reacting in a similar manner to recent events, and hopefully such tragedies won't occur again.  10 stocks we like better than Boeing

494," Delta Air Lines (DAL) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change. A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years. The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Delta basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock. For Delta, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power o f earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Earnings Estimate Revisions for Delta This airline is expected to earn $6.58 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2019, which represents a year-over-year change of 16.5%. Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Delta. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.3%. Bottom Line Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

509," By Tuvan Gumrukcu ANKARA, April 5 (Reuters) - Turkey's main opposition candidate in Istanbul's municipal election said on Friday he remained ahead of his rival after a recount of invalid votes in nearly half of the city's districts demanded by President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party. The AKP, hurt by a slowing economy, is reeling from its apparent loss of Istanbul, Turkey's commercial hub, and the capital Ankara, in Sunday's local elections. The mayoral candidate of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Ekrem Imamoglu, said he was 18,742 votes ahead of his AKP rival, ex-prime minister Binali Yildirim, after a recount of invalid votes in 17 of Istanbul's 39 districts and said that gap would not change much after the recount had ended. ""From what I see, it should end this weekend. It will fall into a 18,000-20,000 range, that's what all the simulations show. These are very tight numbers,"" Imamoglu told Turkey's Fox TV, adding both parties had been awarded votes in the recount. The AKP's Yildirim told reporters on Friday that the margin between him and Imamoglu was falling, adding that the outcome of the recount by the High Election Board (YSK) would be different once all recounts were completed. The AKP has said there are more than 300,000 invalid votes in Istanbul and just under 110,000 in Ankara. It was unclear how many districts of Istanbul - a city of 15 million people - would ultimately see recounts. The AKP has requested them in all 39 Istanbul districts and all 25 districts in Ankara, where the secularist CHP has secured an apparently insurmountable lead of nearly 4 percentage points. Both the AKP and CHP had claimed victory in Istanbul on Sunday night, but the next day they said that Imamoglu held a 25,000 vote lead over Yildirim. In Ankara, the AKP ruling party said on Friday it had submitted an appeal to recount all votes in the capital after an initial partial recount was ""far from meeting our expectations"".  PAINFUL FOR ERDOGAN Ahead of the elections, the CHP formed an electoral alliance with the Iyi (Good) Party to rival the alliance between the AKP and their nationalist MHP allies. The two alliances nominated joint candidates in some cities, including Ankara and Istanbul. The losses in Ankara and Istanbul, if confirmed, would be especially painful for Erdogan, who campaigned relentlessly for the local elections. He launched his political career in Istanbul and served as the city's mayor in the 1990s. Speaking for the first time since Sunday, Erdogan said his alliance had won the majority of seats in Ankara and Istanbul and warned the opposition that, if they won, they would be unable to run the municipalities as they pleased. ""Where will the decisions on local matters, real estate and budgets go through? Through the council. You can't go and say 'I'm the mayor, I'll form the council as I wish',"" Erdogan told reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul. ""If a mayor doesn't have a majority, they can't form the (municipal) commissions and budgets as they please,"" he said, adding that the YSK's decision on the elections would be final. The AKP presided over more than a decade of strong economic growth in Turkey but a currency crisis last year saw the lira lose 30 percent of its value, and inflation and unemployment have risen sharply. Critics also accuse Erdogan of becoming more authoritarian, especially after a failed 2016 military coup. In the Aegean coastal province of Izmir, a CHP stronghold, authorities launched an investigation into the new mayor of the Torbali district, Ismail Uygur, for allegedly insulting Erdogan during a speech. Uygur has denied the accusation. ""The AKP doesn't know how to lose. Democracy means knowing how to lose,"" CHP Deputy Chairman Ozgur Ozel said on Twitter. Imamoglu criticised the AKP's repeated appeals for recounts. ""How much longer can we recount? There are recounts in some places now, but is the logic to recount until I lose?"" ",24.17999999999938,1
510,"By Landon Manning The multitrillion-dollar banking titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is currently head-and-shoulders above competing banking firms in hiring blockchain industry specialists, Forbes reported last month. As jobs-listing website Indeed.com revealed, over the past year, JPMorgan Chase was the only financial firm in the top ten companies that posted jobs containing the words “blockchain,” “cryptocurrency” or “bitcoin.” Forbes went on to note that the only companies to post more jobs in these fields were those directly working in the tech industry, like IBM and Cisco, accounting firms like Deloitte and EY, or blockchain builders like ConsenSys and Microsoft. In February, JPMorgan unveiled its plans to launch JPM Coin, “to use blockchain to simplify payments between its clients,” after building a platform on the Ethereum blockchain “designed to let enterprises capitalize on the benefits of using a shared ledger similar to bitcoin’s blockchain, but with more control over privacy and faster speeds.” Andrew Flowers, an economist at Indeed.com, analyzed blockchain hiring trends and said, “It’s notable that there’s a lack of financial and banking companies hiring for something that’s made to replace money,” and that the site is currently seeing more postings than job searches in blockchain-related fields. Flowers also said that “job-seeker interest has collapsed because it tracks the price of bitcoin” and therefore “is as volatile as the price of bitcoin.” Regardless of the interest that qualified people have in filling these jobs, however, the continued pace of job postings could yield interesting insights into the state of major firms’ relationship to distributed ledger technology. Forbes specifically drew attention to “the recent increase in the number of large companies exploring non-cryptocurrency applications of blockchain,” attempting to mimic the advantages of this same technology that allows money transfers without the use of a bank as a middleman. Indeed.com reported that since 2016, related job postings to the site have increased by 4,086 percent, while job searches have increased by 553 percent, prompting initiatives to try and train new talent to fill in this gap. Forbes stated that the vast majority of these jobs are located in the “usual suspects” of major U.S. cities, taking place in national and regional tech hubs such as San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, New York City, Boston and others.",24.17999999999938,1
511," Picking the right stocks for a portfolio that will ultimately be used for college can be a challenging task. Investors want to pick stocks that don't have too much risk but do have high potential to pay off big over the coming years. We asked three of our Motley Fool contributors for their top stocks for a portfolio built for college, and Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC) , NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) , and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AAXN) were at the top of their lists. Here's why.  Image source: Getty Images. Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): As the cost of college continues to escalate, parents face a daunting challenge as they try to save up for their kids' future. One way they can supercharge their college savings is by investing it in stocks that can generate above-average total returns. While several companies could do just that, renewable-energy-focused utility NextEra Energy has a history of delivering market-beating total returns and has a plan to continue doing so in the coming years. Since 2005, NextEra Energy has expanded its per-share profitability at an 8.5% annual clip, which is the highest among the 10 largest power companies in the country by a wide margin. That consistent above-avera ge earnings growth, when combined with the company's growing dividend, has enabled NextEra Energy to deliver average annual total returns that have outperformed 86% of the stocks in the S&P 500 over that time frame. The company is working hard to continue generating market-beating returns in the future. It's doing so by investing an astounding $40 billion to expand its utility and renewable energy businesses, which should enable the company to grow earnings at a 6% to 8% annual clip through at least 2021. Meanwhile, NextEra has increasing confidence that it can continue expanding profits at around that same rate in future years. That steady earnings growth, which could power continued increases in the company's dividend, should enable NextEra to maintain its market-beating ways, which would provide a nice boost to your kids' college savings plans. Travis Hoium (Axon Enterprise): There's no question law enforcement agencies around the world are adopting body cameras and less-lethal weapons, like tasers, at a rapid rate, and the company riding that wave is Axon Enterprise. The company is the clear industry leader, especially after buying its most ardent competitor, VIEVU, last year . Body cameras and tasers are Axon's core right now, but they're just the start of the company's long-term strategy. A records management system will be launched later this year and will allow customers to capture video and create transcripts for police reports automatically. Dispatch software is expected next year, which will expand the ecosystem to dispatchers as well. Over the last decade, Axon Enterprise has grown revenue more than fourfold, and while net income may not have followed, that's because the company has been investing in growth.  AAXN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts . If you're investing for college and you have a long time horizon, Axon Enterprise is a great stock. It's in a booming market with a large lead in market share and lots of ways to increase profitability as the business matures. Todd Campbell (Canopy Growth): Most of the time, companies must break new ground to have a shot at skyrocketing revenue growth. That's not true of cannabis companies. The marijuana market already exists to the tune of $150 billion annually, according to the United Nations, and market leaders' soaring sales are simply a function of shifting those sales from the black market to regulated, legal marketplaces. Canada's top marijuana company is Canopy Growth, a ganja Goliath on track for over 500,000 kilos of annual marijuana production. Canada's recreational, adult-use, national marijuana market opened last October, and out of the gate Canopy Growth secured over 30% market share . In Q4, Canopy Growth's net revenue after excise taxes was 83 million Canadian dollars , up 283% year over year. The company's not content serving only Canada, either. In January, it announced its plans to establish a hemp processing and research park in New York state. The move will open the door to a market for hemp-derived chemical cannabinoids worth an estimated $600 million per year. Importantly, it sets the stage for a pivot to targeting the $50 billion U.S. marijuana market if marijuana legalization happens on the federal level someday. The potential to profit from pot is reminiscent of the post-Prohibition success enjoyed by beer, wine, and spirits makers. As a result, alcohol giant Constellation Brands invested $4 billion for a 38% equity stake in Canopy Growth last year. The cash infusion gives Canopy the deepest pockets in the industry, positioning it perfectly to take advantage of the marijuana legalization boom. Admittedly, there's plenty of risk associated with this stock, but the potential reward could make Canopy Growth one of the best long-haul investments to add to risk-tolerant portfolios. As different as these three companies are, they all have a lot of potential to grow your portfolio long term. That's what investors looking forward to college costs should be looking for and it's why they're a great place to start your portfolio or add some diversity to what you already own.  10 stocks we like better than Axon Enterprise

The company shelled $121 million for the acquisition. Notably, net proceeds amounting to $115.9 million from the company's recent equity offering was utilized to fund the acquisition. Transactions Details On Mar 28, Healthcare Realty acquired a multi-tenant MOB on Indiana University Health's Methodist Hospital campus in Indianapolis. The purchase price was $47 million. Further, the 143,499-square-foot building is now 100% leased. On the same day, the company acquired two multi-tenant MOBs on the campus of Inova Health System's Fair Oaks Hospital, in the Washington, D.C. region, for an aggregate price of $46 million. The buildings, spanning 158,338 square feet of space, are 72.8% leased. Lastly, on Apr 2, it acquired a multi-tenant MOB, spanning 47,936 square feet, for $28 million. The property, adjacent to Piedmont Hospital in the Buckhead area of Atlanta, is 100% leased. The four properties were acquired at average capitalization rate of 5.3% and are currently 87.7% leased. The transaction enhances Healthcare Realty's foothold in three of its top markets. Further, it strengthens the company's relationships with three preeminent, high-grade health systems. As demand for MOBs continues to surge, Healthcare Realty's focus on this property type is a strategic fit. The heightening popularity of MOBs and outpatient facilities can be tied to the fact that these are considered the safest healthcare realties. This is because MOBs are less vulnerable to reimbursement and regulation changes, and have predictable revenue streams compared with other healthcare real estate assets with similar exposure. In fact, going by statistics, the U.S. hospital and outpatient care-center market is projected to grow from $1060 billion in 2016 to more than $1275 billion by 2020. While companies like While Healthcare Trust of America HTA and Physicians Realty Trust DOC have been benefiting from their existing MOB footprint, peers like HCP Inc.  HCP and Ventas Inc. VTR are emphasizing on strategies to invest more in these healthcare assets.

518," Cash is cumbersome, dirty and increasingly too tangible for our digital desires. And while we’ve already given it up to a fair extent for the credit and debit card--it still means we have to wait in lines, and that’s so 1990s.  In an effort to cut costs and avoid long lines in front of the cash register, a small-but-growing number of retailers have stopped accepting paper currency entirely. Over the past couple of years, some retail stores and restaurants in large cities have simply ceased cash operations. But the problem is that while it may be safer and more convenient to pay without cash, banning the use of cash could be discriminating against low-income individuals without credit or bank accounts because of the fees and minimum balance requirements.  In fact, local and state governments are rather up in arms about the whole thing. Earlier this month, the  Philadelphia City Council passed a bill making it the first major city to ban cashless payments. New Jersey, Now New York City, Washington, San Francisco and Chicago are now all weighing similar bills. ""With a 26-percent poverty rate in Philadelphia, the mayor believes in equal opportunity for all,'' city spokesman  Mike Dunn  said in an emailed statement to USA Today. “It is important to recognize the fact that not everyone has access to banks or lines of credit,” the New York Times cited State Senator  Nellie Pou , one of the sponsors of the bill in New Jersey, as saying. Going cashless is inevitable, but much of the country isn’t ready for that just yet. This was mostly expressed in Philadelphia where more than one-quarter (some 400,000 people) live below the poverty line, according to a  Pew Charitable Trusts report  from last year. With $19,700 a year for an adult with two children at home these families lack access to credit cards. For New Yorkers who don’t want to wait in line anymore, it’s important to consider that despite some of our penchants for going fully digital, we are still largely a cash society. A  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report  from 2017 shows that 6.5 percent of the U.S. households were ""unbanked""; in other words, households in which no individual has a checking or savings account. Another 18.7 percent of households were categorized as “underbanked”. And while those rates are declining all the time, they are still some large hurdles to a cashless society. It’s also worth noting that cash was the most frequently used payment instrument in 2017, accounting for 30 percent of all payments. Credit and debit cards were used in 48 percent of consumer transactions in 2017, of which 27 percent went to debit and 21 percent to credit card payments, according to the    Federal Reserve report  from the fall. Still, financial institutions are using every weapon in their arsenal to fight against cash because their customers are the ones who want to go cashless. Visa  has been offering $10,000 each to as many as 50 restaurants and food vendors to pay for their technology and marketing costs in return for a pledge to go cashless. And e-commerce giant Amazon, for its part, came out in opposition to the New Jersey bill to ban cashless retail outlets. After all, it has five cashless and cashier-less pop-up stores and one bookstore there. Now it’s lobbying local governments who are considering their own ban on Amazon  automated stores. There are only a small number of Amazon Go stores in operation today, but the company was planning to open as many as 3,000 locations by 2021, according to  Bloomberg . Now it might have jumped the gun as local and state governments worry about discrimination and poverty. By Fred Dunkley for Safehaven.com",24.17999999999938,1
519,"Natural gas prices fell into record negative territory in the Permian basin, dragged down by booming oil production and a limited ability to move gas out of the region. Unlike in other places, such as the Marcellus and Utica shales, natural gas in West Texas is produced as a byproduct. This “associated gas” is essentially an afterthought, a surplus and almost irrelevant product that comes out of the ground due to the relentless pursuit of crude oil. Precisely because the natural gas is not the target is exactly why more gas continues to be produced regardless of what prices do. This dynamic helps explain how natural gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas can fall to -$3.38/MMBtu – yes, negative $3.38 – as they did on Wednesday, which means that producers are paying others to take their gas. Javier Blas of Bloomberg News tweeted that prices may have reached as low as -$6/MMBtu. While there has been a critical bottleneck for oil – a lack of pipelines from the Permian to the Gulf Coast led to steep discounts last year – the constraint on gas is even more pronounced. Waha prices near El Paso have been low for months, but the most recent plunge has been exacerbated by equipment problems at two compressor stations in New Mexico, according to Reuters. Waha prices have been in negative territory since March 22. Reuters notes that the spread between Waha and Henry Hub – which has been trading at around $2.70/MMBtu – reached a record high of $6.14/MMBtu on April 3. The situation should clear up a bit when one of the compressors comes back online, expected on April 5. The other returned to service on March 31, Reuters reports. Seasonal lulls in heating demand are also weighing on gas prices. There are pipelines in the works, but the first projects won’t be completed until later this year. “We foresee the pricing issue directly tied to takeaway constraints lasting at least until October 2019, when Kinder Morgan's Gulf Coast Express pipeline is slated to start-up,” Wood Mackenzie said in a commentary on April 3. “Today, the bottleneck is so tight that even slight hiccups can cause massive price swings.” WoodMac said there are some gas pipelines from Texas to Mexico that are scheduled to come online in the second quarter, which could ease the bottleneck, while stronger domestic demand in the summer months may also help. A glut of gas may not affect oil operations because “flaring regulations allow for enough wiggle room for producers to meet output targets,” Barclays wrote in a note. Texas regulators issue permits that allow companies to flare gas for up to 180 days, and the Texas Railroad Commission “rarely denies these,” the investment bank noted. Beyond that, drillers can obtain extensions. The 180-day grace period could be long enough for companies to bide their time until new pipelines come online. “With the Gulf Coast Express in-service target roughly six months away, new wells brought online today might not even need to go through this extension process,” Barclays concluded. It may seem absurd to produce gas and then pay someone to take the gas off your hands, but Permian drillers continue anyway because they are really after the oil. The cost of offloading natural gas at a loss does not necessarily scramble the economics of drilling. “Even with negative gas prices, the vast majority of Permian wells remain profitable to operate. Their economics are driven almost entirely by oil prices, not natural gas,” Barclays said. “With current operating margins of about $30/b, Permian gas prices would have to drop to -$20/MMBtu or so before the typical well would be shut in for economic reasons.” It should be noted that while individual wells may be profitable, small and medium-sized shale companies are largely still posting losses. For instance, a Reuters analysis found that all but seven of 29 shale companies spent more than they earned last year. Ultimately, drillers will press forward on drilling in order to hit their oil production targets. That means that gas output could continue to climb, which means gas prices will likely remain depressed. By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.com",24.17999999999938,1
520," There's simply no industry that'll have investors seeing green quite like the marijuana industry. According to the duo of Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics, the global weed industry is on track to grow by 38% in 2019 to $16.9 billion , with sales more than doubling between 2018 and 2022 to an estimated $31.3 billion. Consistent double-digit growth is hard to come by in the investment world, which is what makes the cannabis industry such a popular choice. But investors are also acutely aware that not every pot stock can be a winner. Although market share remains fluid in the early going, there are telltale signs of worrisome valuations throughout the industry. Perhaps no marijuana stocks are more avoidable in April than the following three.  Image source: Getty Images. Trust me, I do understand the excitement surrounding Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY) . It's had incredible success marketing its cannabis brands to Canada's medical community, has landed two brand-name partnerships with Anheuser-Busch InBev  and Novartis ' generic-drug subsidiary Sandoz, and has close to 80% of its shares owned by private-equity fund Privateer Holdings. This lack of available float is what played a big role in pushing Tilray's stock from a list price of $17 in mid-July to an intraday high of $300 two months later . But any sane investors who read the company's most recent operating results and listened to Tilray's conference call with analysts are going to keep their distance. For the quarter, Tilray recorded a meager $15.5 million in sales and managed only a 20% gross margin on that revenue. Even with an increase in higher-margin alternative products being sold, the company's need to purchase weed from third-party providers (because its own production isn't anywhere near that of its mid- and large-cap peers) wrecked its fourth-quarter margins. Altogether, operating losses tallied $22.9 million in the fourth quarter and $57.7 million for the full year. It's unclear exactly when Tilray has a real shot at being profitable -- and that's a red flag. Another genuine red flag is commentary from CEO Brendan Kennedy . To summarize, Kennedy noted that assets in Canada were overpriced, and that the company sees better investment opportunities in the U.S. and Europe. While the markets for both are larger than Canada over the long run, this strategy shift sounds more like a tap-out in Canada than a decision made from a position of strength. With Tilray switching gears, producing sizable operating losses, and trailing its peers by a mile in the production department, it becomes a bona fide marijuana stock to avoid in April.  Image source: Getty Images. Another pot stock that's a regular on the "" avoid like the plague "" list is drugmaker Insys Therapeutics (NASDAQ: INSY) . Insys has been a mess for years, yet it somehow keeps digging itself an ever-deepening hole. The front-and-center issue for Insys is that its lead drug Subsys, a fentanyl-based sublingual spray for breakthrough cancer pain, is tainted. Insys settled with the U.S. Department of Justice after bribing physicians to prescribe Subsys for off-label use. As a result, the company went from racking up $330 million annually from Subsys in 2015 to just $78.8 million in net sales from the drug in 2018. Between the damage done to the company's image with physicians and patients, and the ongoing war against opioids and fentanyl-based products by the U.S. government, Subsys is in bad shape. Then there's Syndros, a dronabinol oral solution to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Dronabinol is a fancy way of saying synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the cannabinoid that gets a user high. Once deemed a drug capable of between $200 million and $300 million in peak annual sales, Syndros generated just $3.3 million in full-year sales in 2018, and has less than $5 million in lifetime sales since being launch in the summer of 2017. It's been a complete bust for the company . What makes Insys especially avoidable is the company's 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Contained within was a going-concern warning from the auditor , signaling that Insys may not have enough cash on hand to keep the lights on over the next year. With losses mounting, Insys is a marijuana stock you'll want to keep your distance from.  Image source: Getty Images. Rarely will you find a marijuana stock that turned a profit in its lates t quarterly report on this list, but with shares of Village Farms International (NASDAQ: VFF) soaring more than 330% since the year began, it makes for a logical candidate to avoid in April. Unlike most cannabis growers, Village Farms has a fallback . Most of the company's revenue is derived from its vegetable-growing greenhouses, with only a small portion (for the time being) coming from its joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics (NASDAQOTH: EMHTF) . Pure Sunfarms, as the joint venture is known, involves taking 1.03 million square feet of vegetable-growing greenhouse space in British Columbia that belongs to Village Farms and having Emerald Health retrofit it for cannabis production. When fully complete and licensed, it should yield north of 75,000 kilos of weed per year . In Village Farms' fourth-quarter report, it recorded a very small profit from Pure Sunfarms' first sales . The company has also benefited from not diluting its shareholders. Since it has its fallback vegetable-growing business, this lack of dilution, and an uplisting from the over-the-counter exchange to the Nasdaq , has lit a fire under its stock. But here's the problem: Most of the company's revenue comes from low-margin, weather-dependent vegetable-growing greenhouses. For the time being, its joint venture with Emerald Health is producing just a small fraction of its revenue and profits. And it's going to take at least another year before the facility is operating at full capacity. With a lack of real differentiation, and in my opinion a subpar crop yield per square foot relative to the industry average, a 330%-plus gain over the past three months seems highly unwarranted.  10 stocks we like better than Tilray, Inc.

523,"Overview:  Comments by Chinese President Xi, recognizing substantial progress in trade, helped boost sentiment after the US-China negotiators failed to set a date for the meeting between the two presidents.  Although we have argued that the German economy may be past the worst, the sharp drop in factory orders spooked investors.  However, today's stronger than expected industrial output data, lifted by construction, lends credence to ideas that the external sector is the chief weight as the auto industry continues to work through its idiosyncratic challenges. US (and Canada's) job reports area the highlight ahead of the weekend.   China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong markets are closed today, but most Asia-Pacific markets edged higher, though Australian stocks continued to underperform and today's 0.8% loss leaves it flat for the week.  European shares are a little higher to close in on a 2.4% gain for the week. Core bond yields are one to two basis points higher, which is enough to put the benchmark German bund back (slightly) above zero.  Asia Pacific  Reports had played up the likelihood that a date for the meeting between Xi and Trump would be announced as early as yesterday.  A meeting date is only seen possible if an agreement has been struck and the two presidents need to sign-off.  This may seem unremarkable, but it is a concession to China, which wants to avoid the risk that Trump walks out as he did in North Korea.  Trump has seemed to want to leave some things open for Xi and him to resolve.  Xi's comments came after Trump said the deal (which had not been agreed to) would be ""very monumental."" No date has been set, and now reports suggest it may still take several weeks ""to get it down on paper.""  While we have been on the leading edge of the ""green shoots camp"", we see Japan as an exception.  Japan justified our concern earlier today with weak income and spending data.  Household spending slowed in February to 1.7% from 2.0% in January.  It was softer than economists expected.  The fuel for consumption is wealth and income.  Income figures were poor.  Labor cash income shocked with a 0.8% loss.  Economists had expected a 0.9% gain after a 1.2% increase year-over-year in January.  In real terms, it fell 1.1% after having risen by 1.1% in January.  The Australian dollar is firm trading near the highs it has been bumping against this week near $0.7130, putting it up about 0.4% for the week.  There is a large option for A$1.7 bln struck at $0.7100 that expires today.  That makes the Aussie the strongest of the majors this week, volatility often injected by the US jobs report.  The yen, on the other hand, is among the weakest of the majors, losing about 0.7%.  The dollar has set a higher high against the yen every day this week.  After finishing last week near JPY110.85, it is in a ten-tick range on either side of JPY111.70 today. The relevant expiring options are struck at JPY111.50 (~$520 mln) and JPY112.00 (~$885 mln).  Europe  Germany industrial output did not just rise 0.7% in February, exceeding market expectations for a 0.5% increase prior to yesterday's surprisingly weak factory orders, but the 0.8% decline in January was revised away.  A hint may have been provided yesterday with German construction PMI.  The construction sector is including in industrial output in Germany.  The PMI rose to 55.6 in March, from 54.7 in February and 50.7 in January.  Industrial production was lifted by a 6.8% rise in construction.  Manufacturing is still weak and eased 0.2%, which is the fifth decline in the past six months.  Judging from the retail sales and recent IFO survey, and today's report, it appears that the German domestic economy is doing better, but the external sector remains an important headwind.  Spain was not as fortunate.  Industrial output slid 1.1% in February after a 3.6% gain in January.  Prime Minister May has formally requested a delay in Brexit to the end of June.  This may prove to be a bit difficult.  The UK idea seems to be that as long as it leaves before the selection of the next European Commission, it ought not to be required to participate in the EU Parliament elections at the end of next month.  However, the EC's instructions were to accept the Withdrawal Agreement and get a short extension to pass the necessary legislation, leave without an agreement at the end of next week, or seek a longer delay.  There seemed to be two important developments this week.  The House of Commons instructed May to seek a delay to block a no-deal exit.   May, arguably belatedly, has begun talks with Labour, the main opposition party.  However, it is still not clear how May is going to play her hand.  She could seek to work with the two dozen or so Labour MPs who mostly come from ""Leave"" districts, or she could try to cut a deal with Corbyn.  The euro has been confined to yesterday's ranges, which were inside Wednesday's range or roughly $1.1200-$1.1250.  Maturing options are struck at that range today (~870 mln euros at $1.12 and ~2.2 bln euros at $1.1250.  It closed last week a little below $1.1220.   The intraday technicals seem to allow for another attempt on the upper end of the range, but it may prove to be a better sale on a bounce.    Sterling is slightly firmer on the week.  It finished last week near $1.3035 and is now closer to $1.3075.  There is an option for almost GBP220 mln struck at $1.31 that will be cut today. It reached a high near $1.33 this week.  It had tested and held $1.30.  America  The US jobs data is front and center.  There are not many inputs economists can draw on for their forecasts.  The ADP is off-step with a strong February estimate (that was revised up) and the softer March report.  The ISM manufacturing employment rose.  The weekly jobless claims eased during the survey period, and last week fell to 50-year lows, suggesting momentum.  There are practically no other indicators suggesting that the February jow growth a miserly 20k was an accurate reflection of the economy.  We note the stability of the US jobs growth:  averaging 186k over 3 mo, 190k over 6, 209k over 12, and 199k over 24 months.  Other elements of the report are also important for market participants.  Due to the base effect, hourly earnings need to rise by about 0.3% to maintain the year-over-year pace of 3.4%.  It is also possible that the workweek increased from 34.4 hours to 34.5 hours).  The unemployment rate is expected to be steady at 3.8%.  A second poor report would likely weigh on the dollar, with the yen a major beneficiary, as risk would have to come off (stocks down bonds up).  President Trump confirmed reports that he will nominate Cain to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  This nomination, like Moore's, is being bet with derision may many economists.  Both are in favor of easier money, thought Cain has been a fan of a return to the gold standard.  It is recognized that governments often want to influence monetary policy.  As practices have evolved, the power to do so has become more constrained as the independence of the central bank became more necessary to investors.  The power of appointment is the preferred way.  While the economic profession wants monetary policy to be handled by its guild, a monopoly is not necessary.  More importantly, if an executive power of appointment is curbed, won't they be likely to return to more direct ways of influencing monetary policy?  Canada reports its March employment data as well.   The recent string of economic data has been better than expected.  The February jobs gains were strong.  January GDP rose 0.3% instead of 0.1%, and yesterday's IVEY survey jumped to 54.3 from 50.6 in February to return near January's 54.7 reading.  Over the past three months, Canada has averaged job growth of 43.5k (full-time 26.3k) and a 48.3k average for the past six months (full-time 29.2k).  Economists anticipate a payback for the heady 55.9k increase in February (67.4k full-time) in March.  The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey is for a 10k increase in headline job growth (with a little more than half coming from full-time positions).  Ahead of the job reports, the US dollar is trading firm against the Canadian dollar near the week's highs (~CAD1.3375).  Support has been established near CAD1.3300, and a close above CAD1.34 would lift the tone.

528," Taubman Centers, Inc. TCO has an impressive footprint of dominant retail malls, located in posh regions that have high average sales productivity in the United States. This will likely enable the company to tide through the challenges prevailing in the retail real estate space. In fact, its tenant roster boasts some high-quality national retailers, ensuring a steady source of rental revenues for the retail landlord. This has also enabled the company to witness 10 consecutive quarters of positive sales growth in fourth-quarter 2018. The company is making strategic attempts to drive organic growth. Specifically, in an effort to realize operational efficiencies, Taubman undertook a restructuring of its workforce and reorganization of several functions. The company has also undertaken strategic moves to put into place a number of cost-saving initiatives and reduce its pre-development spending. These efforts are likely to reduce its expenses, while driving bottom-line growth. Additionally, it has been focusing on several cross-sell initiatives, as well as merchandising and productivity improvements at its retail centers. As part of such initiatives, the company is replacing lower volume tenants with higher productive retailers. Such efforts are likely to support its net operating income (NOI) growth. Moreover, Taubman remains committed toward boosting shareholder wealth. In fact, this March, the company announced a 3.1% hike in its quarterly dividends. It has an impressive track record of paying dividends and has hiked dividends 22 times since 1996. Such shareholder-friendly moves boost investors' confidence in the stock. Nevertheless, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences and patterns, with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. In addition, retailers unable to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies. This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs like Kimco Realty Corp. KIM , The Macerich Company MAC , SITE Centers Corp. SITC and Taubman, as the trend is bringing down demand for the retail real estate space considerably. This has led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, impacting Taubman's operating performance. It might drag the company's bottom-line results, hindering its ability to pay high dividends. In addition, given its international presence, unfavorable foreign-currency movements remain a concern for Taubman. Additionally, the company anticipates its share of consolidated and unconsolidated interest expense to be up this year, on a year-over-year basis. The upswing indicates higher interest rates and greater borrowing. Hence, any rise in interest rate will be unfavorable for Taubman, restricting its ability to refinance debt and impact the company's financial results.

530," If you want to make hundreds of dollars just by opening a new bank account, here's what you need to know first.  Image source: Getty Images. It's a tempting offer -- open a new bank account and get $100, $300, or sometimes even more than $500. No matter how successful you are, we all like free money. Bank account bonuses can be a little more complicated than just free money, though, so you shouldn't rush into one without fully understanding it. To make sure a bonus offer is a good deal and to keep your hands on that bonus after you get it, there are a few important rules you'll need to follow. The terms of these bonus offers can vary significantly, and if you don't fulfill all the requirements, you'll miss out on the cash. Offers typically include one or more of the following types of requirements: Many banks keep it simple and just require you to make and maintain a minimum deposit in your account or have at least one direct deposit. Others require a combination of these, which can get complicated and will give you more to keep track of. Quite a few banks charge monthly maintenance fees for their accounts. You can often avoid fees by fulfilling certain requirements, such as maintaining a minimum daily balance in the account or having a minimum amount in direct deposits per month. Before you pull the trigger on opening a new bank account, see what kind of fees there will be and whether you'll be able to get them waived. If you're not paying fees for your current bank account but you will for a new account, then those fees will eventually cost you more than you make through the bonus. The whole reason banks offer bonuses is to acquire and keep customers, so they almost always include language in the terms and conditions stating that you must have the account open for at least a certain amount of time to keep your bonus. If you try to close the account before that time has elapsed, then the bank can claw back your bonus. A ""claw back"" is when the bank deducts the bonus amount from your balance when you close the account, essentially meaning you tied up your money in the account for no good reason. Although some consumers try churning through bank accounts to collect as many bonuses as possible, this isn't a good strategy for the typical consumer. Many of the best bank account bonuses require you to make and maintain a minimum deposit of over $10,000, with some even requiring $50,000 to $100,000. You can make over $500 with bonuses like that, but tying up $50,000 just so you can make $500 is a waste. A bank account bonus is a nice extra, but it's only worth your time to open a bank account if you actually like its features and plan to make the most of it. In the market for a new bank account? Fortunately, many of the best banks offer bonuses as incentives to convince you to sign up. Just make sure you follow the rules above so you can be confident that you're getting the best deal -- and that you won't lose out on that bonus because of a simple mistake.",24.17999999999938,1

533," Shares of Neptune Wellness Solutions (NASDAQ: NEPT)  declined 12.1% in March, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . For context, the S&P 500 returned 1.9% last month. This month, the stock has climbed 5.4% through Thursday, April 4. The Canada-based company, which last fall changed its name from Neptune Technologies & Bioresourrces (yes, a double ""r""), has traditionally been focused on nutraceuticals. Leveraging its experience in extraction, purification, and formulation of value-added products, Neptune Wellness recently entered the cannabis market. In late March, it announced that it had ""completed initial commercial production lots and is now shipping cannabis extracts from its licensed, GPP [good production practices] facility"" in Quebec.  Image source: Getty Images. Neptune Wellness didn't announce any negative news last month, nor was it the specific subject of any such news. So, we can probably attribute the stock's March decrease largely to weakness in the overall sector. The group generally had a strong start to 2019, so pullbacks on profit-taking shouldn't be unexpected. Last month's release of weaker-than-expected quarterly results by several top cannabis companies likely added to the negative sentiment. For context, shares of major Canadian cannabis growers Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC) , Tilray , and Cronos Group dropped 8.5%, 19.4%, and 14.8%, respectively, in March. Speaking of Canopy, in June, Neptune announced that it entered a multiyear agreement, including minimum volume commitments, with the Canadian cannabis grower. Under the terms of the agreement, ""Neptune will supplement Canopy Growth's extraction, refinement, and extract product formulation capacity,"" according to the press release. Despite last month's pullback, Neptune Wellness stock is still having a good year, driven by investor excitement about the company's entrance into the cannabis market. It's up 30.3% in 2019 through April 4, outpacing the broader market's performance by about 2-to-1.  Data by YCharts. Neptune Wellness has not yet announced a date for the release of its results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2019. Those results will give investors a very early indication of how the company's new cannabis business is performing. In Neptune's recent press release about its completion of its initial production run of cannabis extract, CFO Mario Paradis said that management continues to expect positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) from the cannabis business within its first year of production. The company currently is not profitable. As with most cannabis stocks, Neptune stock should be considered risky and volatile.  10 stocks we like better than Neptune Wellness Solutions

534," Marijuana stocks have never been hotter, and cannabis investors are looking beyond the companies with which they're most familiar to embrace the second wave of companies making their appearance on U.S. stock exchanges. Aphria (NYSE: APHA) started trading in the U.S. last November , just after the Canadian legalization of recreational cannabis became effective, and investors have looked closely to see whether Aphria's results would live up to the promise that its top executives see in the company. Aphria recently told investors that it plans to release its fiscal third-quarter financial report on Monday, April 15. That'll give those following the marijuana industry another data point to assess how recent events are affecting Aphria and by extension some other key players in the cannabis space. Data source: S&P Global Market Intelligence . CA$ = Canadian dollars. CA$1 = $0.75. Aphria has had an eventful few months in its short history as a U.S.-listed marijuana stock. In January, the company gave a strong report for its fiscal second quarter, with net income climbing to 21.7 million Canadian dollars, up 63% from the fiscal first quarter. Net income soared as Aphria realized substantial gains from the sale of various investment positions, and even on a normalized basis accounting for those divestitures, the cannabis company performed well on the top and bottom line. However, Aphria also faced some challenges . Internal costs showed up both in reduced adjusted gross margin figures and on the expense side of the income statement, with the company citing higher packaging costs and increased expenses related to its expansion efforts as pushing average cost per gram up 35% for its dried cannabis products and 42% overall.  Image source: Aphria. Even more potentially disruptive were big moves in the C-suite. CEO Vic Neufeld and co-founder Cole Cacciavillani gave up their executive roles at Aphria, in response to controversy over allegations that short-selling investors made against the insiders about its acquisition of LATAM Holdings . Even though an internal investigation subsequently found that the acquisition wasn't improper, interim CEO Irwin Simon has remained at the helm. Since then, Aphria has been making smart strategic moves. In late February, the cannabis company signed a licensing agreement with Manna Molecular Science to develop transdermal patches with cannabis extracts . Aphria hopes that the patch products will help those who want to take advantage of any health benefits of using cannabis but don't want to smoke marijuana or ingest cannabis-derived oils through softgels, and Manna has substantial experience in the field. With the opportunity to offer a value-added product line, Aphria could have a path to differentiate itself from its many marijuana rivals. More recently, Aphria has also taken steps to spotlight its international aspirations. Earlier this month, it introduced the CannRelief line of cosmetics and nutraceuticals for the German market, using its distribution access to more than 13,000 pharmacies across Germany. As more jurisdictions across the European Union look to legalize cannabis, there should be more opportunities for Aphria to capitalize on similar releases. Some investors wonder why Aphria hasn't made more aggressive moves toward enlisting a larger partner in the consumer goods space. That strategy has worked well for some of Aphria's competitors, but at least for now, the interim CEO doesn't believe that it's a necessary one to follow. Even as Canadian cannabis companies start looking southward at the opportunity to enter the U.S. market through the recent federal legalization of hemp products, Aphria expects it can use its existing relationships to build a thriving business worldwide. Aphria shares are up 65% so far in 2019, and marijuana investors will therefore want to see encouraging signs that the cannabis company is just getting started with its fastest phase of growth. Aphria has some historical baggage it needs to overcome, but if it can generate the business success that investors are hungry to see, then its shares could add to their recent gains after the April 15 report.  10 stocks we like better than Aphria Inc.

535," British American Tobacco (NYSE: BTI) outpaced the market last month by rising 16% compared to a 1.8% uptick in the S&P 500 , according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence . The rally put shares in solidly positive territory so far this year, although the global tobacco giant remains lower by over 30% in the past 52 weeks.  Image source: Getty Images. Investors were happy with the broader operating and financial metrics that the company revealed on the last trading day of February. Tha t report showed that revenue rose 25%, or 3.5% after adjusting for recent acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit expanded at double that pace, in part because of success in marketing high-margin e-cigarettes. ""[British American Tobacco] performed well in 2018,"" CEO Nicandro Durante told investors in a press release, ""exceeding our target of high single-digit adjusted constant currency EPS growth."" Persistent declines in sales volumes for traditional cigarettes are pressuring the company's long-term earnings power. Investors are also worried about regulatory changes that might limit tobacco companies' ability to sell e-cigs. Investors have to weigh those risks against attractive aspects of owning this stock , including its over 6% annual dividend yield.  10 stocks we like better than British American Tobacco

The boost added to a strong 2019 so far for the luxury goods specialist, with shares up 33% year to date while the broader market is up 15%.  Image source: Getty Images. Tiffany's late-March earnings report contained few surprises for investors. Sales slipped into positive territory to modestly trail management's reduced outlook. Executives again blamed volatile spending by Chinese tourists for the shortfall, but also highlighted major achievements in the broader fiscal year including record sales and rising profitability. CEO Alessandro Bogliolo and his team are predicting another record sales year in 2019, with gross profit margin improving as well. However, investors will likely have to wait until the second half of the year before those positive trends become clear. That's because Tiffany's outlook implies that softer demand and increased spending will keep the company in the red over the next six months or so. The stock's recent rally suggests investors are confident that this trend will reverse itself just in time for the 2019 holiday shopping season.  10 stocks we like better than Tiffany & Co.

540," By Syed Raza Hassan KARACHI, Pakistan, April 5 (Reuters) - Pakistan's finance minister on Friday ruled out a further devaluation of the rupee, which has lost about 25 percent of its value over the past year, urging people to invest in the stock market and not waste money buying dollars. Since coming to power in August, much of the government's focus has been in staving off a balance of payments crisis. It is in talks with the International Monetary Fund over a 13th bailout since the 1980s which is expected in the next few weeks. ""Today, State Bank of Pakistan has given a categorical statement that rupee is in equilibrium. Central bank cannot speak clearer than this,"" Finance Minister Asad Umar told a business gathering at the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachithrough a video link. ""There is no reason for big devaluations."" He added that there were no demands for what the exchange rate should be in the talks with the IMF. ""In the IMF talks, let me clarify that it is not even a demand by them what should be the dollar exchange rate,"" Umar told reporters later in Islamabad. ""Yes, there is a discussion about what should be the exchange rate management."" Traditionally, Pakistan has kept its exchange rate over-valued, incurring losses to the economy, the minister said. The rupee should be aligned with its fundamentals and its benchmark should be the real effective exchange rate (REER), he added. The minister advised people not to waste money buying dollars, but instead invest in the stock market. ""One should not say the rupee would comfortably become stable or inflexible in terms of movement. It will remain flexible, but one should not expect big devaluation,"" Fawad Khan, head of Research at BMA Capital Management Limited, told Reuters. The minister's remarks would help bring stability, Khan said. ""Overall, the statement has been taken positively by the equity market,"" he told Reuters. The question of whether the finance minister should have given this statement or not was another issue, Khan said, because the management of the exchange rate is the joint responsibility of the ministry of finance and the central bank. Umar said the IMF bailout would likely be finalised in meetings with the lender and the World Bank next week. ""My estimate is that in those meetings as we have come very close it is almost done, in principle,"" he said. ""God willing, it will be close there, and after that we can sign an IMF agreement by inviting their staff mission."" ",24.17999999999938,1

547," BOSTON, April 5 (IFR) - - Markets Look to Payrolls to Get Better Bead on Economy - Relatively Strong Report Expected; Highly Unpredictabe Though - Payrolls, Wages and Workweek, Consumer Credit, Fed's Bostic The treasury market has more or less returned to the its post-FOMC-meeting levels, after which it seemed to have taken temporary leave of its senses in an unrestrained if ultimately ill-advised grab for yield and duration. The move was mainly a market reaction to the Fed's dovish policy pivot but also to a host of global central bank dovish pivots. The concern was that this was to be the new normal and a trend that would solidify over coming weeks and months. The market moves were also heavily influenced by the collapse in Germany's PMI that helped vault the German 10-year bund yield well through the zero-bound into negative yield territory. Over the last week or so the markets appear to be having a major rethink, that instead of a global synchronized slowdown leading to a global recession, perhaps more of a goldilocks scenario is in the offing. The central banks' dovish pivots alone would be conducive to such a consequence. The markets though appear to see more on which to hang their more constructive hats, mainly being a stabilization (if not a turn for the better) in the pivotal Chinese economy. If there was a clairvoyant leading indicator presaging last year's global slowdown it was the Chinese equity markets. These markets turned south mid-year and entered bear market territory into the fall well before the dart-throw of divining what the neutral interest rate is. Chinese equity markets recently entered bull market territory. Something to consider. As well, and not withstanding Germany's PMI collapse, global PMIs appear to be bottoming. Many economic forecasts now lean toward a second-half global economic recovery, though we've heard that before. Certainly optimism in this regard is coming from the confidence that the U.S. and China will achieve a comprehensive trade deal that would help resurrect increased global trade flows or the lifeblood of the global economy. Of course, there are risks that U.S. will then turn their trade dispute attention to the EU. Even so, this doesn't preclude a favorable outcome. Brexit is a challenge still looking for a favorable outcome. As expected, the UK has asked for another extension (until June 30) with this or an even longer extension likely to be granted. It's a headache that won't go away perhaps, but one that the markets can push to the side for the time being. Moving to the forefront is this morning's payroll report. Most anecdotes (e.g., claims, small business and other surveys) suggest the U.S. job market remains robust. A vulnerable point would be the scarcity of both skilled and non-skilled workers. It's hard to say if this held back last month's job gains where likely playing a part as well were unseasonal weather, legacy challenges from the government shutdown in January, and just the margin of error that for the payroll report being +/- 1% (or +/- 153k jobs). Given last month's weak reading, this morning's report has taken on a higher level of economic/market importance. Should the report once again prove to be unexpectedly weak it would recommence recession watch and have many clamor for the Fed to lower rates. The higher probability though is that the report comes in close to consensus. This would obviously alleviate market and Fed concerns and keep alive the second-half recovery story. The market will not only be looking at the number of jobs gained/lost, but also at wage gains and any change in the workweek. Consensus is for 175k new jobs, with 0.3% in wage gains and for the workweek to edge higher by a tenth to 34.5 hours. Nothing to sneeze at here and such a report that risk markets will likely greet favorably. Levels to look at from a consensus or stronger report would be where the market stood going into the FOMC meeting (2.45% in 2s, 2.40% 3s, 2.40% 5s, 2.49% 7s, 2.59% 10s and 3.00% in 30s). Again, the market's current price action suggests this (higher yields) is the desired direction of travel. Market positioning is currently seen as fairly neutral though with a renewed interest from the markets leveraged contingent to favor the short side. Seen as influencing both real and leveraged traders alike is the renewed move higher in global equities. Should this persist with a goldilocks economic backdrop it is likely that the market will need to further correct the pricing in of any Fed ease for this calendar year. Speaking of the Fed it would be remiss not to touch on the news that the President may nominate both Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to the Fed's Board of Governors. Both are seen more as political hacks and yes men to the President that should they get through the Senate confirmation process would likely be viewed with a bit of contempt by the markets. Hard to say how this derision would play out in the market, though a steeper yield curve, a weaker dollar, wider TIPs break-even spreads and perhaps less foreign sponsorship of treasuries wouldn't be that farfetched. It was a rather quiet overnight session with overseas accounts taking a respite from their recent buying spree in deference to this morning's pivotal payroll report. Germany did have a better than expected reading on Industrial Output that came in at 0.7% versus expectations of 0.5%. Spain's Industrial Output did fall by 0.3% whereas a 0.0% reading was expected however the previous month was revised higher by 0.3%. With it all the preferred approach is that of a neutral range trader looking to be reactionary to how the payroll report prints. Look for a range of 2.58% to 2.48% in the 10-year. The strategic bias is flat, though expects to look for a strength selling opportunity out the curve. The curve bias is in a 3s/10s steepener from 22.75 bps. The long wait for the March Employment Situation Report is over. At 08:30, the BLS is expected to report increases in nonfarm payrolls of 180k overall and 170k in the private sector. These would follow disappointing gains of 20k overall and 25k private in February. Factory employment alone is expected to have increased by 10k in last month, following just a 4k advance in February. The unemployment rate is seen holding steady at 3.8%, while growth in average hourly earnings is expected to slow to +0.3% m/m in March versus +0.4% m/m in February. The year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings should remain unchanged at +3.4%. The markets expect a 0.1-hour uptick in the duration of the regular workweek, to 34.5 hours. At 11:15, the New York Fed will update its Staff Nowcast for the change in real GDP for the first and second quarters. In last Friday's update, Q1 growth was projected at +1.31%, while Q2 growth was seen rising at a 1.62% annual rate. The Federal Reserve will publish February data on consumer credit outstanding at 15:00. The Reuters poll consensus calls for an increase of $17.0 bn on the month, essentially the same gain as in January (+$17.05 bn). There are no Treasury or Agency MBS issuance activities scheduled. At 15:30, Atlanta Fed President Bostic (non-voter, dovish) will participate in a lecture and discussion on ""Disruption and Opportunity: Shaping Policy in a Digital World"" at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies and the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia.

548," By Tom Arnold LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - The flow of fresh funds to emerging markets should recover this year and next after a flood of money over the past decade, fuelled by loose monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan, the Institute of International Finance said on Friday. The IIF predicted non-resident capital flows of $1.26 billion in 2019, up from $1.14 billion in 2018, and another modest recovery next year. Quantitative easing by G3 nations in recent years helped funnel funds to emerging markets, in search of yield. That led to a ""positioning overhang"", with investors overloaded on emerging-market assets, the IIF said. Flows to China accounted for much of the recovery in the first quarter, it said. Excluding China from previous quarters showed successive recoveries were weaker. ""Despite a positive growth backdrop, capital flows to non-China emerging markets will recover modestly in 2019 and 2020, while remaining short of the levels observed in 2017,"" the report said. Total net capital flows to China are projected to reach $50 billion in 2019 and $110 billion in 2020, the IIF said. Non-resident capital inflows to Turkey should start to increase in the second half of 2019, assuming credible structural reforms helped to improve sentiment. But net inflows of non-resident capital are likely to moderate further in 2019, in step with the projected fall in output, the IIF said. Turkey's lira has come under renewed pressure in recent weeks, after shedding nearly 30 percent against the dollar last year. That led to local banks halting lending to their overseas counterparts last week, a move that spooked foreign investors. ",24.17999999999938,1
549," By Collin Eaton HOUSTON, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is set to speak in Houston on Friday carrying a tough message against Venezuela's government to an expatriate community eager for more actions to oust the country's president, Nicolas Maduro. An estimated 50,000 Venezuelans live in greater Houston, the second-largest expat community outside of south Florida. Many support U.S. efforts to rid Venezuela of Maduro, having fled the socialist politics of former leader Hugo Chavez for a home in Houston's energy industry. The Trump administration is considering new sanctions to sap the Maduro government of oil revenue, which provides 90 percent of the OPEC member nation's export income, White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said last week. Sanctions ""are making it difficult for Maduro. But those people will not get out without a big push from the international community,"" said Carlos Sanchez, a former employee of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA, who moved to Texas after Chavez fired thousands of oil workers in 2002. Sanchez lives in Katy, a dozen miles (20 kilometers) west of Houston's energy corridor where ConocoPhillips, BP America and Venezuela'sCitgo Petroleum Corp have local headquarters. Katy has so many expats, he said, it is sometimes called ""Katy-zuela. Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan native and Latin American energy expert at Rice, said many Houston expats want Pence to offer a plan to get the Venezuelan military to stop supporting Maduro. ""There's a lot of concern about ‘what's the plan now?'"" Monaldi said in an interview. ""It doesn't seem the military is willing to remove support from Maduro"" and accept Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is backed by the United States and most Western Hemisphere countries. Some anti-Maduro residents here believe sanctions are not enough. ""We want to see more than barking. We want to see action,"" said Miguel Eljuri, a Venezuelan living in Houston who also once worked for PDVSA. He and other expats interviewed this week said they wished the United States would form a military coalition to force Maduro out. Some said they would return to the Latin American nation under a new administration. ""There's a lot of people who would like to go there,"" said Luis Savcic, a former Venezuelan oil worker who joined Marathon Petroleum Corp in Houston. ""Engineers, doctors, skilled labor should go back."" Some large oilfield service companies with operations in Venezuela have identified Venezuelan employees now outside the country who could help rebuild the nation's energy industry once a new administration is in office, Monaldi said. ""Houston will play a tremendous role in the reconstruction of Venezuela,"" Monaldi said. ""The human resources of its oil industry have been devastated."" ",24.17999999999938,1

551," By Gabriel Burin BUENOS AIRES, April 5 (Reuters) - The outlook for Brazil's real has weakened for the first time since President Jair Bolsonaro took office at the start of the year as an eruption of political tension cast doubts on his pension reform drive, a Reuters poll showed. The median estimate of 26 analysts surveyed April 1-4 for the Brazilian currency is 3.70 per dollar in 12 months. This projection is 4.7 percent stronger than its value on Thursday but ended three months of improving prospects. This week, officials sought to calm market fears sparked by Economy Minister Paulo Guedes' threat to quit if other government members and allied lawmakers did not support plans to drastically change Brazil's retirement system. Progress of any diluted version of the initiative to save over 1 trillion reais ($260 billion) over the next decade ""should frustrate current expectations, leading to a devaluation of the real"", Lavieri said. In a sign of increasing bearish sentiment towards the currency, eight of 11 strategists that answered a separate question saw risks for the real skewed to the downside - the first negative balance in five months. Benign external conditions should offset Brazil's homegrown problems. ""We remain relatively optimistic on BRL ... along with EMFX as a whole, due to reducing global headwinds for emerging markets"", said Simon Harvey, FX Analyst at Monex Europe. A likely rate cut in the U.S. may prompt a sell-off in the U.S. dollar, he added. And ""with Chinese authorities expected to intervene to maintain a high growth rate ... an increase in external demand suits Brazil's balance of trade"".  DELICATE PESO STABILITY In Mexico, a sense of delicate stability for the peso persisted among analysts. The median forecast for the peso in 12 months was 20.0750 per dollar, 4.3 percent weaker than its value on Thursday and not far from recent surveys. Investors continue to see the country's hawkish central bank as a counterweight against worries arising from frictions with the U.S. and populist overtures by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, or AMLO as he is commonly known. ""The (peso) exchange rate is likely to remain stable as long as interest rates stay high and spending is kept under control"", Leonardo Flores, FX director at Multiva, said. ""We could still see some volatility due to outside factors"". Promising to end what he calls neoliberal projects in Latin America's second largest economy, López Obrador said this week he would pursue ""a better distribution of wealth"", while dismissing low growth estimates from his own team. Doubts over future government moves were one of the reasons cited by Fitch Ratings behind the decision to slash its forecast for the expansion of Mexico's economy this year to 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent. Analyst discontent with Mexico's administration is becoming more evident. There is ""uncertainty caused by AMLO's chaotic and incoherent economic policies"", said Peter Grimsditch, editorial director and head of consulting at Oxford Business Group. All 9 economists that answered a separate question saw risks for the Mexican peso tilted to the downside. After heavy losses during 2014-2016, it has been trading around 19.0 since 2017 with a range of approximately +/- 2.0 pesos. The survey also reflected the usual firm expectations for the pesos of Chile and Colombia as well as the Peruvian sol. Even the Argentine peso got a respite, with strategists anticipating less depreciation for the beleaguered currency. ",24.17999999999938,1
552," The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX has seen its shares rally almost 17% in the past three months, outpacing the industry 's growth of 12%. The company has been mainly gaining on sturdy comparable store sales (comps), which in turn has been backed by continued rise in traffic. Clearly, the company's efforts to enhance store and e-commerce business are yielding. What's Behind TJX Companies' Solid Record?

TJX Companies has been reporting positive comps for a while now. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the company's consolidated comps grew 6% year over year, fueled by increased customer traffic at all segments. The company's apparel and home businesses remained strong in the quarter. Notably, the quarter marked the 18th straight period of higher customer traffic at Marmaxx as well as the entire company.  In fact, all segments reported higher comps, courtesy of consumers' favorable response to the company's brands and impressive merchandise assortments at reasonable prices.

Clearly, this leading off-price retailer is benefiting from efforts to drive traffic and sales. Well, major retailers like Walmart WMT , Dollar Tree DLTR and Kohl's KSS are also largely gaining from their respective comps record. Moreover, TJX Companies regularly opens stores and expands across the United States, Europe and Canada. While many retailers are resorting to store closures, the company added 236 stores during fiscal 2019, taking the total store count to 4,306 as of Feb 2, 2019. The company intends to continue expanding store base with plans to operate about 6,100 stores in the long term.

Further, with increasing number of consumers resorting to online shopping, TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen e-commerce business. The company's off-price model along with its strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products has been driving performance both in stores and online. Also, the company is committed toward boosting comps growth through effective marketing initiatives and loyalty programs.

Incidentally, TJX Companies' aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have been boosting traffic at its stores. The company's gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) also help it improve customer engagement.

Will Momentum Stay?

Though wage and freight costs, and currency woes are expected to play spoilsports in fiscal 2020, consumers' favorable response to TJX Companies' impressive brand portfolio and consistent rise in customer traffic keep management encouraged. In fiscal 2020, the company's consolidated comps are expected to grow 2-3% and comps at Marmaxx are also anticipated to grow in the same range. That said, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to sustain its impressive momentum.

553," Apogee Enterprises, Inc. APOG is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Apr 11, before the opening bell. Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Quote  Earnings Whispers

Our proven model shows that Apogee is likely to beat estimates in fourth-quarter fiscal 2019. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:

Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Apogee is +1.41%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at 96 cents and 95 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Zacks Rank: Apogee currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zack Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

Factors at Play

Apogee expects that each of its segments has opportunities to increase market share, expand into new geographies and markets, and roll out products. These growth opportunities are supported by the solid bidding and order activity, a robust and increasing backlog, and continued favorable outlook for the North American commercial construction market. Apogee anticipates that the Architectural Glass segment will benefit from strong order flow which will support top-line growth for the fiscal fourth quarter and over the next several quarters as well. Moreover, the company expects its Large-Scale Optical (LSO) segment to record top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.

However, Apogee witnessed lower revenues and profits in Architectural Framing Systems in third-quarter fiscal 2019, reflecting reduced volumes due to project timing delays. The company believes this near-term impact will carry over into the soon-to-be-reported quarter.

Regarding acquisitions, Apogee is primarily focusing on the integration of EFCO to recognize margin opportunities. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company continued to make investments, in a bid to improve operations at EFCO, along with other strategic projects to enable growth.

The Zacks Consensus Estimates for Apogee's earnings per share is pegged at 91 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter - reflecting a 9.6% increase year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Mar-end quarter is pegged at $357 million, representing a year-over-year improvement of 1.1%.

Meanwhile, Apogee had earlier reduced its outlook for fiscal 2019. The company expects revenue growth to be between 6% and 7% for the fiscal compared to the prior guidance of 8-10%, with lower projected revenues in the Architectural Glass and Architectural Framing Systems segments. Apogee projects earnings per share for the fiscal at $3.13 compared to the earlier guidance of $3.13-$3.33. The company also revised its operating margin guidance to 8.4% from the previous 8.3-8.8%.

Apogee's shares have lost around 8.1% over the past year compared to the industry 's decline of 8.5%. Stocks to Consider

Here are a few other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:

Bloomin' Brands, Inc. BLMN has an Earnings ESP of +6.45% and holds a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Ally Financial Inc. ALLY has an Earnings ESP of +32.60% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

556," Greenbrier Companies (GBX) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of $1.02 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of railroad freight car equipment would pos t earnings of $0.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.54, delivering a surprise of 12.50%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. Greenbrier, which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry, posted revenues of $658.67 million for the quarter ended February 2019, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.34%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $629.34 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call . Greenbrier shares have lost about 15.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 14.9%. What's Next for Greenbrier? While Greenbrier has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power o f earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Greenbrier was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

557," By Jan Strupczewski and Francesco Guarascio BUCHAREST, April 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers agreed on Friday to disburse 970 million euros ($1.09 billion) as a grant to Greece as part of a post-bailout programme of monitoring reforms, euro zone officials said. The money was conditional on Athens respecting its reform commitments, especially a law on banks' recovery of debt that goes bad, which will help reduce the large burden of non-performing loans on Greek lenders' balance sheets. The money comes from profits made by euro zone central banks on Greek government bonds and the reduction to zero of the step-up interest margin on certain euro zone loans to Athens. ""In cash this adds up to a grant of 970 million euros. It also sends investors a positive signal of continued ownership of the reform agenda in Greece, and you can see this already going on in the markets today,"" Centeno said. Yields of Greek benchmark 10-year bonds fell from 3.609 pct at opening on Friday to 3.511 percent on the news before rebounding to 3.544 percent. The funds will boost Greece's already large cash buffers and are a signal for investors that Greek economic policy has the stamp of approval from the country's largest creditor -- the euro zone. Greece exited its last bailout in August after eight years of financial support from euro zone governments and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The head of the euro zone's bailout fund Klaus Regling told the news conference it would make sense for Greece to repay early the loans it got from the IMF, because some of them were very expensive. ""Out of the 9.5 billion outstanding debt to the IMF, on one third, 3.5 billion, Greece has to pay almost 5 percent interest rates, so that's substantially higher than what Greece pays in the markets,"" Regling said.

558," By Robin Emmott and Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS, April 5 (Reuters) - Tensions over trade, investments and minority rights may prevent China and the EU from agreeing a joint declaration at a summit next week, four diplomats in Brussels said on Friday, sapping a European push for greater access to Chinese markets. Alarmed by potential Chinese dominance of strategic European industries, EU leaders last month sought to prepare for the April 9 summit - flagged as an opportunity to cement bilateral ties - by agreeing what they said was a more assertive stance towards Beijing. According to an early draft of the final EU-China communique, the European Union aimed to bind Beijing into completing talks on an investment agreement and committing to remove what the EU says are unfair barriers to trade. The EU also wanted to show the United States that the trade war route was not the only way to coax Beijing to open up. But Chinese officials have removed or changed many of those references, the EU diplomats said, raising the embarrassing probability of no communique at all after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk have met. ""It's a mess, so no we face the prospect of no statement,"" one senior EU diplomat said. Other EU references to reassure Europeans that China is committed to confronting attacks by computer hackers and improving religious freedoms for the Muslim Uighur minority are also proving very difficult, the diplomats said. ""We wanted to be clear on how we want to work with China, not issue a meaningless document,"" a second diplomat said. Another said China was stalling on important issues and there would be no statement without a change in stance from Beijing. The Chinese foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. Earlier this week Vice Foreign Minister Wang Chao told reporters both sides were working to reach a consensus. A meeting of EU envoys in Brussels failed to find a solution on Friday morning, one EU official said. Another said negotiations with the Chinese would continue until Tuesday.  RE-EVALUATION The intensification of EU diplomacy since March reflects frustration over China's reluctance to allow foreign companies to set up there without restrictions while taking full advantage of the EU's openness, EU diplomats say. A surge of Chinese takeovers in critical sectors in Europe and an impression in Brussels that Beijing has not kept its promise to stand up for free trade and globalisation have given the April meeting new urgency. The EU-China relationship, which is bound by 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) in daily trade, has survived previous spats, notably in 2016 and 2017 when differences over the South China Sea and trade meant there were no communiques. However, after a collective re-evaluation of Chinese policy by EU leaders on March 21, the six-page April 9 statement was meant to coax Beijing into making good on promises to deepen trade ties. In the EU's draft, the two sides would ""agree by summer 2019 on a set of priority market access barriers and requirements facing their operators."" The statement also set 2020 as the goal for a special treaty to increase investment flows. ($1 = 0.8906 euros) ",24.17999999999938,1

560," By Ahmed Elumami and Ayman al-Warfalli TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya, April 5 (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan troops commanded by Khalifa Haftar said on Friday they had advanced into the southern outskirts of the capital Tripoli in a dangerous thrust against the internationally recognised government. Fighting was going on near the former international airport, which Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) force controlled by nightfall, an LNA spokesman and residents said. It came as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres departed after meeting Haftar to try to avert civil war. ""I leave Libya with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli,"" he said on Twitter. The U.N. Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on the latest developments on Friday and expressed deep concern in a statement read after the meeting by German U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, president of the council for April. ""They (the council) called on LNA forces to halt all military movements. They also called on all forces to de-escalate and halt military activity. There can be no military solution to the conflict,"" Heusgen said. Haftar, 75, who casts himself as an opponent of Islamist extremism but is viewed by opponents as a new Gaddafi, was quoted by Al-Arabiya TV as telling Guterres the operation would continue until terrorism was defeated. The coastal capital Tripoli is the ultimate prize for Haftar's eastern parallel government. In 2014, he assembled former Gaddafi soldiers and in a three-year battle seized the main eastern city of Benghazi. This year, he took the south with its oilfields. As well as visiting Haftar in Benghazi, Guterres had been in Tripoli this week to help organise a national reconciliation conference planned for later this month. But that plan looked in jeopardy on Thursday as LNA forces took Gharyan, about 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital after skirmishes with forces allied to Tripoli-based, U.N.-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. From there, Haftar's forces moved north, first taking the village of Suq al-Khamis, about 40 km (25 miles) from Tripoli, after some fighting, a resident and an eastern military source said. Then on Friday, the LNA said it took the areas of Qasr ben Ghashir and Wadi al-Rabie on the southern outskirts of the capital, seizing the former Tripoli International Airport, which has been abandoned since a 2014 battle.  SETBACK TO MEDIATION PLAN The LNA was in control of the former airport, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said, rejecting a claim by the Tripoli interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, that his forces had retaken it. The LNA said it had lost five soldiers since Thursday. While the advance has looked fast, so far Haftar's force has mainly crossed sparsely populated areas after taking Gharyan, the last town in the mountains before the road descends to a coastal plain. In 2014 battles for Tripoli, it took advancing fighters weeks to reach the city centre from the old airport as snipers bogged them down. Forces from Misrata, a city east of Tripoli, sent more reinforcements to defend Serraj, residents said. Major ministries are still 20 km away. Despite their gains, Haftar's forces failed to take a checkpoint about 30 km west of the capital in a bid to close the coastal road to Tunisia. An LNA-allied armed group withdrew overnight from so-called Gate 27, leaving it abandoned in the morning, a Reuters reporter said. And in another setback, forces allied to Tripoli took 145 LNA fighters prisoner in Zawiya, west of the capital, a western commander, Mohamed Alhudair, told Reuters. An LNA source confirmed 128 had been captured. Armed groups allied to the Tripoli government have moved more machinegun-mounted pickup trucks from the coastal city of Misrata to Tripoli to defend it against Haftar's forces. The offensive is a setback for the United Nations and Western nations trying to mediate between Serraj, 59, who comes from a wealthy business family, and military veteran Haftar. They met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss power-sharing. The United Nations wants to find agreement on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya, an oil producer and transit point for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara with the aim of reaching Europe. Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see him as a bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily, according to U.N. reports. The UAE, however, joined Western countries in expressing its deep concern about the fighting. Russia said it was not helping Haftar's forces and it supported a negotiated political settlement that ruled out any new bloodshed. Tunisia has tightened control on its border with Libya in response to the renewed conflict, the defence ministry said. Former colonial power Italy, which lies across the Mediterranean and has been a destination for migrants, was very worried, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said. ""We need to throw water on the fire, not petrol on the fire. I hope that people, acting out of economic or business self-interest, are not looking for a military solution, which would be devastating,"" Salvini said. ",24.17999999999938,1

565," By Ahmed Elumami and Ayman al-Warfalli TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya, April 5 (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan troops commanded by Khalifa Haftar said on Friday they had advanced into the southern outskirts of the capital Tripoli in a dangerous thrust against the internationally recognised government. Fighting was going on near the former international airport, which Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) force controlled by nightfall, an LNA spokesman and residents said. It came as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres departed after meeting Haftar to try to avert civil war. ""I leave Libya with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli,"" he said on Twitter. The U.N. Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on the latest developments on Friday and expressed deep concern in a statement read after the meeting by German U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, president of the council for April. ""They (the council) called on LNA forces to halt all military movements. They also called on all forces to de-escalate and halt military activity. There can be no military solution to the conflict,"" Heusgen said. Haftar, 75, who casts himself as an opponent of Islamist extremism but is viewed by opponents as a new Gaddafi, was quoted by Al-Arabiya TV as telling Guterres the operation would continue until terrorism was defeated. The coastal capital Tripoli is the ultimate prize for Haftar's eastern parallel government. In 2014, he assembled former Gaddafi soldiers and in a three-year battle seized the main eastern city of Benghazi. This year, he took the south with its oilfields. As well as visiting Haftar in Benghazi, Guterres had been in Tripoli this week to help organise a national reconciliation conference planned for later this month. But that plan looked in jeopardy on Thursday as LNA forces took Gharyan, about 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital after skirmishes with forces allied to Tripoli-based, U.N.-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. From there, Haftar's forces moved north, first taking the village of Suq al-Khamis, about 40 km (25 miles) from Tripoli, after some fighting, a resident and an eastern military source said. Then on Friday, the LNA said it took the areas of Qasr ben Ghashir and Wadi al-Rabie on the southern outskirts of the capital, seizing the former Tripoli International Airport, which has been abandoned since a 2014 battle.  SETBACK TO MEDIATION PLAN The LNA was in control of the former airport, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said, rejecting a claim by the Tripoli interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, that his forces had retaken it. The LNA said it had lost five soldiers since Thursday. While the advance has looked fast, so far Haftar's force has mainly crossed sparsely populated areas after taking Gharyan, the last town in the mountains before the road descends to a coastal plain. In 2014 battles for Tripoli, it took advancing fighters weeks to reach the city centre from the old airport as snipers bogged them down. Forces from Misrata, a city east of Tripoli, sent more reinforcements to defend Serraj, residents said. Major ministries are still 20 km away. Despite their gains, Haftar's forces failed to take a checkpoint about 30 km west of the capital in a bid to close the coastal road to Tunisia. An LNA-allied armed group withdrew overnight from so-called Gate 27, leaving it abandoned in the morning, a Reuters reporter said. And in another setback, forces allied to Tripoli took 145 LNA fighters prisoner in Zawiya, west of the capital, a western commander, Mohamed Alhudair, told Reuters. An LNA source confirmed 128 had been captured. Armed groups allied to the Tripoli government have moved more machinegun-mounted pickup trucks from the coastal city of Misrata to Tripoli to defend it against Haftar's forces. The offensive is a setback for the United Nations and Western nations trying to mediate between Serraj, 59, who comes from a wealthy business family, and military veteran Haftar. They met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss power-sharing. The United Nations wants to find agreement on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya, an oil producer and transit point for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara with the aim of reaching Europe. Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see him as a bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily, according to U.N. reports. The UAE, however, joined Western countries in expressing its deep concern about the fighting. Russia said it was not helping Haftar's forces and it supported a negotiated political settlement that ruled out any new bloodshed. Tunisia has tightened control on its border with Libya in response to the renewed conflict, the defence ministry said. Former colonial power Italy, which lies across the Mediterranean and has been a destination for migrants, was very worried, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said. ""We need to throw water on the fire, not petrol on the fire. I hope that people, acting out of economic or business self-interest, are not looking for a military solution, which would be devastating,"" Salvini said. ",24.17999999999938,1
566," Shares of Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) , an online car-selling and financing platform aiming to remove the traditional auto-dealership infrastructure, popped 33% in March thanks to multiple moves aimed at bolstering its top and bottom lines. One development that sent its stock up mid-March is a little complicated. Carvana filed an ABS-15G report for asset-backed securities known as Carvana Auto Receivables Trust 2019-1. Essentially, Carvana can pool a batch of its loans and sell them to third-party investors in a move that will lower its risk and its cost of funds, and improve its financing income. ""This transaction is an exciting development for Carvana's financing platform,"" CEO Ernie Garcia said in a press release. ""Our inaugural transaction introduced our product to the market, was well received by investors, and marked a significant step toward achieving our long-term financing profitability goals."" In addition to bolstering its financing business, Carvana made multiple moves to expand its footprint and its operations. One move was unveiling a new car-vending machine ( which is more important than many realize) in Pittsburgh. Standing eight stories tall and holding 27 vehicles, the intriguing vending machine will help drive its brand image, marketing, and ability to deliver a better consumer experience.  Carvana's Pittsburgh vending machine. Image source: Carvana. In addition to its new vending machine, Carvana also launched operations in three additional Texas markets mid-March: Killeen, College Station, and Waco. That brings the company to nine total markets in Texas, a key growth state for Carvana. It also launched additional markets in Prescott, Arizona, and Dayton, Ohio. Last, but not least, was the announcement of Carvana's newest vehicle inspection center, which improves production capacity to meet growing demand as the company continues to rapidly expand into new markets. Carvana's inspection center will improve the company's ability to inspect, test, repair, and paint its vehicles and reach more of the Midwest population with as-soon-as-next-day delivery. Investors should also note that Carvana entered March with a wave of momentum from its Feb. 27 fourth-quarter financial result that highlighted a 105% increase in retail units sold, a 121% increase in revenue, and a 156% increase in total gross profit, versus the prior year. Looking beyond March, the company has two primary goals: expand efficiently and improve its gross profit per unit (GPU). Already in April, the company is having a huge week in California, another key growth state. It launched operations to offer as-soon-as-next-day delivery in Modesto, Salinas, Santa Cruz, Stockton, Vallejo, and Visalia, bringing its total number of California markets to 13, and 115 markets across America. It's clear the company is expanding well, and that's boosting investor optimism around its growth story. But equally important will be the company's ability to improve GPU, which it has a track record of doing successfully. Consider that in 2015, Carvana posted $206 GPU, which exploded to $2,133 GPU in 2018, and is expected to reach $2,650 in 2019. CarMax 's comparable figure for GPU was roughly $3,811 during fiscal 2018 -- so Carvana has room for improvement and growth. Carvana is up nearly 90% year to date. With plenty of room for top-line and retail sales growth and higher GPU, and more opportunities to place car vending machines to drive its brand image, there's plenty of reason to expect more strong months for the online car dealer.  10 stocks we like better than Carvana Co.

570," Back when I edited a daily newspaper, I hired reporters, paginators, editors, and the occasional photographer. Any job posting resulted in a flood of resumes, but many of them were moved into the ""no"" pile immediately. In most cases, the easiest rejections weren't the people who were totally unqualified. In fact, some of those used their cover letters to make a viable case for getting at least a phone interview. The easiest ones to reject were people who made these mistakes.  Your cover letter is a way to persuade the person hiring to interview you. Image source: Getty Images. Some big companies sort resumes via automated tools, making a cover letter obsolete. That means you can skip writing when the application process leaves no place to attach one. In every other case, however, it's important to have one. And, just having a cover letter isn't enough. You need to craft a cover letter that shows you're applying for this specific job. Address something in the job ad and connect your skills as directly to the position as possible. If there's something being asked for that your resume does not clearly show you as having, explain how you can meet that need (or explain how you will gain that skill). As I've covered in the past , I'm generally against the concept of putting an objective on a resume. Doing so almost never adds anything, and even a well-crafted one comes off as contrived in most cases. Having an objective won't get your resume put on the scrap heap if it makes sense. If I'm hiring a reporter and your objective is ""to use the skills I learned at my college newspaper to land an entry-level reporting job,"" that makes sense and is not off-putting. In many cases, though, objectives are either too generic -- ""to secure a position at a firm that can use my skills"" -- or actually conflicting. If you're applying to be a night watchman and your objective is ""to land a job where I can be outside during the day,"" well, then you're not doing your candidacy any favors. If I look at a resume and there's a large gap in employment that's not explained, it's a major red flag. Maybe you left the workforce for school, maybe you left for family reasons, or perhaps you went to prison for some terrible crime. You don't need to be incredibly specific. It's OK to explain a gap in vague terms (unless it is for something like a prison term that will be discovered on a background check). In general, it's OK to be a bit vague: ""I was out of the workforce for three years dealing with a health-related issue."" That could be cancer, a sick parent, or rehab, but it's at least an explanation. Not offering at least some reasoning for a gap makes it seem like you're trying to hide something. Think of your resume and cover letter as a coming attraction trying to get the person doing the hiring to want to see the feature (you). Make every word in each one count. A cover letter is an opportunity to show your personality and make a case for yourself beyond the raw accomplishments shown on your resume. Your resume is a chance to show not just dates and job titles but hard accomplishments you achieved in those jobs. Take the time to make each application personal and relevant. Avoid the temptation to just apply for a lot of jobs and hope you get noticed. Quality is better than quantity, and spending more time fine-tuning should result in more interviews.

571," BRUSSELS, April 5 (Reuters) - The European Union's Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Commissioner Karmenu Vela said on Friday the bloc was hoping to maintain reciprocal access to UK fishing waters after Brexit but was also preparing for the alternatives. Vela told a news conference: ""In case of a no-deal Brexit, EU fishing vessels would have to leave UK waters and UK vessels would have to leave EU waters. This would have significant negative economic consequences on the part of the EU fleet, which depends on access to UK waters."" ""Obviously, even on the part of the UK fleet fishing in EU waters."" The impact of Brexit on the fishing industry is particularly sensitive for EU states like France, Ireland and Denmark. Fishermen from the other EU states fish more in the UK waters than the other way around, a point often raised by Brexit backers in Britain. But the EU says most of the UK's exports of processed fish products go to continental Europe. The bloc wants to allow for both these factors in any fishing deal with the UK after Brexit to increase its leverage where Britain could otherwise have a much stronger hand. ",24.17999999999938,1

) led the way, gaining another 5% as investors continue to celebrate its split withDowDuPont (NYSE:
DWDP
). At the other end of the spectrum, Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) fell more than 8% following a first-quarter delivery report that was shockingly lower than its fourth quarter figures. Headed into the final trading day of the week, it's the stock charts of Hartford Financial Services Group (NYSE:
HIG
), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:
FCX
) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:
MS
) that are of the most interest.   In mid-March, Morgan Stanley shares had proven they were range-bound . Although the bulls had proven they were willing to take their shot, they hadn't proven that could actually get MS stock over the proverbial hump. On the other hand, at least Morgan Stanley stock was finding support in all the right places, remaining in the hunt for yet another breakout effort. The effort the buyers made on Thursday has pushed MS shares just a hair above a nagging resistance line and is challenging another one. One more good day could do the trick, although realistically speaking, Morgan Stanley will still likely need to fall back again before putting in the breakout effort that takes hold once and for all. Click to Enlarge • The technical ceiling that has been cleared is the $45 area, where MS peaked in January and again in March. It's plotted in yellow on both stock charts. • Shares of Morgan Stanley are also testing the white 200-day moving average line, but clearly paused there when put to the test. • Although momentum has actually been building for weeks, between Wednesday's opening gap (highlighted on the daily chart) and waning volume on the way up, the bulls may need to slide back first and fill in that gap before punching through the big ceiling.   The last time we looked at Freeport-McMoRan back on March 21 , it had just pushed off of support offered by its 50-day moving average as part of the bigger-picture rebound effort that began in January. At the time, however, it wasn't above the more pivotal line in the sand. That's happened in the meantime. While it took some time and work, Thursday's session cleared a huge technical hurdle. Click to Enlarge • That ceiling was the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. It was resistance in February, but was unable to hold the buyers back this time around. • Bolstering the bullish case are not one but two instances of support at the purple 50-day moving average line. Each is highlighted on the daily chart. • Zooming out to the weekly chart, we can clearly see the downtrend that shaped most of 2018's selling, framed by blue lines, has been broken, yielding to a new, bullish trading range plotted by red lines on the same chart.   Like most other names, Hartford Financial Services Group enjoyed a fantastic January and February, erasing a miserable October through December. But also like most stocks, HIG stock has been stagnant since March, mostly moving sideways. That has changed this week though, and decisively so on Thursday. Shares are up and over a pretty big technical hurdle, and they've cleared it with some compelling underpinnings. Click to Enlarge • The hurdle in question is $49.70, plotted in yellow on both stock charts. That level had been resistance a few times over the past few weeks, but yesterday's close of $50 puts in in the rearview mirror. • Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see the $49.70 area has been a ceiling before, as well as support. • The clincher is the ""golden cross"" plotted on the daily chart. That's where the purple 50-day moving average line has crossed back above the white 200-day moving average, hinting at a new bullish uptrend.

The company has also significantly outperformed its industry 's decline of roughly 9% over the same time frame.   Let's take a look into the factors that are driving this industrial gases giant.

What's Working in APD's Favor?

Upbeat outlook and healthy growth prospects have contributed to the gains in Air Products' shares. The company is poised for growth in fiscal 2019 on the back of its project investments, new business deals and acquisitions.

Air Products continues to expect adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 in the range of $8.05-$8.30, reflecting a 10% increase at the midpoint year over year. Also, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.80-$1.90 per share for second-quarter fiscal 2019, up 8% at the midpoint year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2019 for Air Products is currently pegged at $8.18 per share, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of 9.8%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register a 13.9% growth in fiscal 2020.

Air Products' strategic investments in high-return projects, productivity actions and contributions of acquisitions should drive its fiscal 2019 results. The Lu'An syngas project in China, which is now fully onstream, contributed to the results in the company's Industrial Gases - Asia segment in the fiscal first quarter. The company expects the Lu'An project to contribute more than 25 cents per share to its earnings in fiscal 2019.

Moreover, in February 2019, the company announced that it has successfully achieved the mechanical completion of the world's largest industrial gas complex in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The industrial gas complex is expected to be onstream in phases in 2019. This is one of the biggest projects executed by Air Products.

Air Products has a total available capacity to deploy (over fiscal 2018-2022) roughly $16 billion in high-return investments, aimed at creating significant shareholder value. The company has already spent or committed more than half of this capacity.

Last month, the company also completed the buyout of ACP Europe SA, which is the largest independent carbon dioxide business in Continental Europe. The buyout enables the company to serve existing customers better and tap new industrial gas growth opportunities. Customers will gain from a broader liquid carbon dioxide supply position across additional regions of Europe as well as greater density throughout Continental Europe. Air Products noted that the acquisition provides it a strong platform to pursue further industrial gas growth in Europe and deliver value to customers.

Air Products also remains committed to boost productivity to improve its cost structure. The company is seeing positive impact of its productivity actions and expects to benefit from additional productivity and cost improvement programs in fiscal 2019.

Moreover, Air Products remains committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong cash flows. The company, earlier this year, raised its quarterly dividend by more than 5% to $1.16 per share, marking the 37th straight year of dividend hike. The company plans to return more than $1 billion in dividends in 2019.  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Price and Consensus  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

578," It's amazing what a difference a decade makes. Just 10 years ago, no country had legalized recreational marijuana, only a relatively small number of U.S. states had given the OK to medical cannabis, and a mere 44% of Americans polled by Gallup were in favor of a nationwide legalization of weed. Fast-forward to today, where two countries have given the green light to recreational marijuana (Canada and Uruguay); 33 U.S. states have legalized medical pot, with 10 also allowing adult-use consumption; and a whopping 66% of the American public now favors full legalization . It's this growing support and broadening number of legalizations within the U.S. and worldwide that have pushed growth estimates for the industry through the roof and sent pot stocks soaring.  Image source: Getty Images. Perhaps no marijuana stock has been a bigger beneficiary of this growth than Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC) . The largest pot stock in the world by market cap, Canopy has seen its share price rise from the mid-$1 range to $43 per share over the trailing four-year period, giving it a market cap of about $15 billion. Currently, Canopy Growth is the only marijuana stock that's a legitimate large cap. As you can imagine, there's a lot for Wall Street to like about Canopy Growth. This is a company that's managed to get more than 4.3 million square feet of its aggregate 5.6 million square feet in cultivation space licensed by Health Canada. The remainder should be licensed by the end of the year, leading to peak annual production of more than 500,000 kilos, assuming an average yield per square foot relative to the industry. Canopy Growth is also flush with cash following a third equity investment from Corona and Modelo beer maker Constellation Brands , which closed in November 2018. This latest investment totaled $4 billion and gave Constellation a 37% equity stake in Canopy. Constellation also received warrants that it could execute in the future, which would increase its stake to 56%. Canopy Growth ended its fiscal third quarter with about $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, giving it more than enough capital to make complementary acquisitions, diversify its product line, market and build its brands, and enter new markets. This is also a company that's done an excellent job of pushing into overseas markets and securing more than 70,000 kilos in domestic supply deals. And yet, Canopy Growth is also priced very aggressively. Wall Street isn't expecting it to generate a recurring profit until 2021  at the earliest, and the company has been hit, like most growers, by a supply chain bottleneck in Canada. This has caused sales estimates for all growers, but most notably Canopy Growth, to plummet. With Canopy already sporting a $15 billion market cap, the truth of the matter is there are considerably more attractive pot stocks out there for investors to consider buying.  Image source: Getty Images. Although it had what was perceived to be a subpar fourth-quarter report, per Wall Street, CannTrust Holdings (NYSE: CTST) looks like a much smarter way to play the cannabis grow industry than Canopy Growth, at this point. Unlike most pot growers, CannTrust is leaning on hydroponics at its flagship Niagara facility and its much smaller Vaughan campus. Hydroponics involves growing plants in a nutrient-rich water solvent as opposed to traditional soil. Assuming a grower has cheap access to water and electricity, which is precisely the case with the Niagara facility, hydroponic growing techniques can offer superior per-gram production costs compared with traditional soil-based operations. Not to mention, CannTrust's Niagara facility incorporates a lot of technology, including the perpetual harvest system that has moving containerized benches. In short, this should lead to steadier (i.e., less lumpy) harvests and very low-cost production. In January, following a roughly six-month-long cloud of uncertainty overhanging CannTrust, the company and the town of Pelham agreed on a 390,000-square-foot, phase 3 expansion of the Niagara facility. Having already completed 450,000 square feet, this additional capacity should help CannTrust push to about 100,000 kilos of yearly production. Furthermore, in the company's fourth-quarter press release, it announced its intention to acquire 200 acres of land and put this land to work by growing 100,000 kilos to 200,000 kilos of cannabis outdoors . This essentially vaults CannTrust into the top five, if not top three, growers by peak production. Sporting a market cap of less than $800 million, CannTrust may be too cheap to pass up.

This is an acquisition-heavy niche at the moment, with most dispensary operators appearing to overpay for rivals in order to push their brand into new states. The costs associated with constructing cultivation farms, processing facilities, and retail stores are also high, leading to operating losses for most pot stocks in this space. But Trulieve Cannabis (NASDAQOTH: TCNNF) is an exception. Whereas many of Trulieve's competitors have a growing presence in 10 or more states, this is a company that's been primarily focused on Florida's medical marijuana market. Trulieve currently operates more than two dozen retail locations in Florida, which is expected to become a multibillion-dollar market for medical weed sales . Also, the average age of Floridians is higher than the national average, making it more likely that medical cannabis products could help with the ailments they're dealing with. Trulieve Cannabis did make two acquisitions late in 2018 that'll see it move into Massachusetts and California -- the latter of which is expected to be the largest legal market in the United States. However, the company's central focus on the Florida market has been the key to keeping recurring operating expenses down. In the third quarter, Trulieve recognized $28.3 million in sales, but operating expenses tallied just $8 million, meaning it's one of a rare number of pot stocks that's profitable on an operating basis . While it's possible that operating expenses could rise substantially as Truelieve pushes into California and Massachusetts, its established footprint in Florida makes it a much more attractive company, fundamentally, than Canopy Growth.  Image source: Getty Images. Lastly, I'd encourage investors to think small in the growing space and consider a specialized company like Flowr Corp. (NASDAQOTH: FLWPF) . A quick glance at Flowr Corp.'s production right now probably wouldn't lend a ton of encouragement. The company is only producing at an annual run rate of about 5,000 kilos, but it's hard at work building out its Kelowna campus in British Columbia. When complete, Flowr's flagship campus will be producing about 60,000 kilos a year beginning in 2021. So, what makes a mid-tier producer so special? Namely that Flowr is focusing on a niche of the growing space that few other companies are: ultra-premium cannabis . Most of the dried flower on dispensary shelves is currently of the discount or average variety, with little in the way of premium cannabis for sale. The thing is, premium flower has a much higher price point than average flower (as expected), but is far less prone to pricing pressure. This means premium weed can safely produce higher margins. The consumer Flowr is targeting is also different from the typical marijuana user. Flowr's customer isn't likely to be entrenched in traditional cannabis culture. Rather, they're a more affluent user looking for something unique to enhance their cannabis-use experience. This means the company's target customer is unlikely to be phased by minor fluctuations in the Canadian economy. The company's Kelowna campus should also yield about 300 grams to 450 grams per square foot . That's roughly three to 4.5 times better than the industry average. Although it's not profitable at the moment, Flowr's unique focus should lend to exceptionally strong operating margins and profits within the next two years. As such, it's worth a serious look by investors.  10 stocks we like better than CannTrust Holdings Inc

579," LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Ethical investors working on a global standard for tailings dams have written to 683 listed resource companies, including major miners, asking for information to be made public within 45 days about every facility they control. The safety of dams used to store mining waste, known as tailings, has gain prominence after the collapse of a Vale tailings dam in Brazil in January killed an estimated 300 people. The International Council on Mining and Minerals (ICMM) industry group said in March it was working with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) to develop new standards. The PRI brings together ethical investors, including the Church of England, overseeing around $80 trillion worth of investments. Aidan Davy, chief operating officer of ICMM, which represents 27 miners including Vale, said it and its members recognised the value of enhanced disclosure. He added that it was important ""to get this information from all of the industry"" not just the ICMM members. The demand for disclosure has been sent by the Church of England Pensions Board and the Swedish Council on Ethics following meetings in March and on April 1. The investors meet again in May. They are asking companies to disclose on their websites within 45 days answers to 20 questions, covering issues such as the height of dams, their volume, engineering records and safety checks. If they cannot provide the requested information, they have to state what action they are taking to address the situation. The two biggest listed miners, BHP, and Rio Tinto, , said they would not comment on the letter, sent on Friday, until they had assessed its contents. Anglo American in an email said it would make this information available. ",24.17999999999938,1
580," April 5 (Reuters) - Britain's second-biggest housebuilder Persimmon Plc said on Friday it was launching an independent review to find whether measures to improve its business have been effective. The review, to be led by Stephanie Barwise QC of Atkin Chambers, an independent chair, will look into aspects including customer care approach, systems and culture, quality assurance processes, and speed and consistency of response to issues. The finding will be presented by the last quarter of 2019, Persimmon said. ""To assess the effectiveness of the new measures and processes and to determine whether they appropriately position the business for the future, Persimmon's Board ... has commissioned an independent review."" Persimmon faced an investor mutiny last year over its former chief executive's pay and had said in February that interim CEO Dave Jenkinson would take on the role permanently after Jeff Fairburn stepped down last year amid criticism of his $100 million bonus package. British housebuilders have been facing a sluggish housing market. Persimmon, however, has focused on building cheaper family houses and have sold more homes in 2018 despite the Brexit gloom. The company also said on Friday it would adopt the principles of the Hackitt Review. Engineer Judith Hackitt was with leading a review into building regulations and fire safety after the Grenfell Tower fire (graphic). ",24.17999999999938,1
581," By Naomi Tajitsu TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn is back in the Tokyo detention centre where he previously spent 108 days, after being released just last month on a $9 million bail. Prosecutors arrested the once-feted executive on fresh charges of financial misconduct on Thursday. His former employers, Japan'sNissan and France's Renault, initially appeared to be at odds over his case when he was first arrested in November, but now seem to have closed ranks against him.  WHAT ARE THE NEW ALLEGATIONS, HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT? Ghosn was arrested again on suspicion of funnelling $5 million from payments made by a Nissan subsidiary to a third party for personal gain. An internal Nissan investigation has identified the party as a Nissan distributor in Oman. He is already fighting charges of under-reporting his Nissan salary for nearly a decade through 2018, and a charge of temporarily transferring personal financial losses to Nissan's books during the global financial crisis around 2008. The new allegation is potentially more serious, as it could show that he used company funds for his own purposes. Renault too is investigating payments it made under Ghosn's watch to the same company in Oman. The outcome of that probe could deepen the French automaker's exposure to the scandal, which so far has been largely focused on Nissan.  HOW DOES THE NEW CHARGE AFFECT GHOSN'S TRIAL? Ghosn's lawyer has said the new charge will prolong his legal proceedings. It is, however, not clear how much more prison time he could face if charged and found guilty on the latest allegations. He already faces a maximum of 10 years and a 10 million yen($89,517.50) fine if found guilty of the current charges. Ghosn's trial is expected to start later this year.  HOW CAN GHOSN BE RE-ARRESTED WHEN ALREADY OUT ON BAIL? Arresting a suspect who has been released on bail is highly uncommon, and Japanese prosecutors have said they ""humbly"" recognised any international criticism over the latest arrest. But prosecutors also cited the concern that Ghosn could destroy evidence while out on bail as impetus for arrest. Legal experts say that re-arresting a suspect who has been released on bail suggests that prosecutors continue to look for new charges - and may be concerned about the chances of winning a guilty verdict with the current charges.  WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE GHOSN'S INITIAL ARREST? Since his November arrest on the tarmac of a Tokyo airport, Ghosn has faced a swell of allegations. Renault initially sought to avoid being drawn into the investigation initiated by Nissan - which ousted Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest - and for weeks avoided sharing the Japanese partner's findings with its own board. He was forced out as Renault chairman and CEO in January. Nissan has found that its own regional subsidiary made questionable payments of more than $30 million to the Omani distributor, while one source has told Reuters that the total sum paid by Renault is in the double-digit millions. Renault has also turned over evidence that the 50,000-euro($56,145) rental of Ghosn's Chateau de Versailles wedding in 2016 had been improperly charged to the company. Nissan's investigation has also revealed the purchase of several properties around the world, including a Beirut house, by the company for Ghosn's use. A joint audit of the Renault-Nissan BV alliance management organisation has tallied 1.2 million euros in Lebanese donations and other spending of questionable benefit to the car makers, among preliminary results presented to Renault directors. It has also been alleged that he used around $600,000 in Nissan funds to pay his children's university tuitions. Sources told Reuters this week that Renault had uncovered suspect payments to a Renault-Nissan business partner in Oman while Ghosn was CEO, which may be connected to the purchase of a luxury yacht worth millions of euros.  WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Ghosn will remain in custody until April 14 after a court approved his detention. Prosecutors can apply for an additional 10 days detention, after which they must indict or release him. If indicted, Ghosn's legal team can apply, again, for bail.

584," By David Brooke US Twenty consecutive weeks of outflows After withdrawing US$792.6m from loan funds in the week ending April 3, just over half the sum of the prior week, retail accounts now represent just 11% of the investor base for US leveraged loans, the lowest share since LPC began tracking the data in August 2012. It was the 20th consecutive week of outflows in the asset class and follows the Fed's announcement on March 20 to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 2.25%-2.5% while signalling steady rates all year. The share of retail investment in leveraged loans has not been as low since the first half of 2016, when loan funds made up 12% of the market from January to July. The Fed has been raising interest rates since December 2015. In total, 2018 saw total outflows of US$4.2bn after a sell-off in November and December. Throughout the vast majority of the year there was inflows into the market. Loan funds had assets of US$167.76bn last November before dropping to US$141.2bn in March, according to LPC, a unit of Refinitiv. As a proportion of the leveraged loan market, that dropped from 14% on November 18 to 11% in March. Many investors have switched to bonds as per the shift in the Fed's strategy, driven by evidence of a slowing economy. High-yield bonds saw an inflow of US$589.7m in the last week of March and US$1.796bn in the previous week, according to Lipper. CLO funds continue to make up the largest base of loan buyers at around 50%, according to LPC.  PRIMARY CONCERN The softening in retail demand opens up the space for institutional investors to be more selective over credits coming to the market, but some are concerned it may have a cascading effect on the primary side. ""It's not surprising that we are seeing that preference hit the high yield market rather than the loan market,"" said Jon Poglitsch, head of credit research at Highland Capital. ""It's a contrast with last year when high yield bond issuance came off and second-lien loans came into favour in certain circumstances. There may be a reversal of that as appetite for high yield paper increases and firms will also downsize term loans,"" he said. After the Fed raised rates in December, and announced that it was likely to slow down the pace in 2019, loan fund outflows reached new levels in a direction of capital that has continued since November. The latest announcement from the Fed saw outflows reach a new high for a full week in 2019 and such swings in the availability of retail money is a contrast from institutional investors that are less dependent on interest rates. ""It helps to have long-term capital in the face of technical volatility. If there is something we want to buy, we can make space in funds needing to build to par or funds that have a total return focus,"" said Lauren Basmadjian, senior portfolio manager at Octagon Credit. ""There has been more volatility in the secondary loan market and that has been driven by outflows in the first three months of the year. It's pretty rare for one quarter to see such movement that is technically driven,"" she added.  GREATER SCRUTINY Red-hot demand for loans in the last couple of years has meant borrowers have been able to push for greater flexibility in documentation. The majority of primary issuance is covenant-lite, but borrowers have also sought to inflate Ebitda add-backs and include incremental facilities to hand themselves greater freedom to manage assets in the event of a downturn. But a continued reduction in the retail investor base may open the door for institutional investors to push back on flexible documentation packages. ""We passed on a number of deals that weren't attractive, due to inappropriate capital structures or deficiencies in the documentation,"" Poglitsch said. ""But with increasing outflows there is likely to be more scrutiny of the terms in some situations, a reversal of the environment that persisted for much of 2018 when large retail investor inflows provided a conducive climate for borrower-friendly issuance,"" he said.

587," BUCHAREST, April 5 (Reuters) - France is not specifically targeting U.S. internet giants with a planned tax on digital service companies, its finance minister said in an interview, pushing back against pressure from Washington to drop the levy. The U.S. State Department said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged France in a meeting with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian on Thursday not to approve the digital services tax, saying it would hurt U.S. technology firms. ""France is not leading a crusade against the United States. The United States are an ally and a friend of France. France is leading a crusade against tax injustice - it's not the same thing,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters. The emergence of internet giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon has pushed international tax rules to the limit because they are able to book profits in low-tax countries rather than where the customer is located. The U.S. Treasury's top international tax official, Chip Harter, said last month in Paris that such taxes were potentially ""discriminatory"" and said Washington was looking into whether it could retaliate under WTO rules and trade treaties. Washington has said that it is better to pursue broader international tax reform at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD). France also firmly supports work at the OECD to update decades-old international tax rules to take better account of the digital era and has promised to drop the French tax when there is a global deal. ""I call on our American friends and partners to step up work at the OECD so that we can reach as quickly as possibly - in 2020 I hope - an international solution,"" Le Maire said.

589," lululemon athletica inc. LULU displayed significant growth over the years, on the back of robust quarterly performances, which testify its smooth progress on the strategy for 2020. The company's growth strategy mainly focuses on digital and international expansion, enabling it to deliver on targets for 2020 and boost shareholder value.  The fiscal fourth-quarter results reflected a solid holiday season, backed by positive response to merchandise assortments along with continued investments to drive business growth. Further, lululemon is likely to witness strong momentum across the business while executing growth strategies in the future. Consequently, management provided a solid view for the first quarter and fiscal 2019.

Let's now delve deeper and find out factors that are likely to help retain the uptrend in lululemon's stock.

Factors Narrating lululemon's Growth Potential

As part of efforts its 2020 strategy, lululemon is focused on enhancing the e-commerce retailing channel, and investing in the innovation of product categories and bringing improvements to its website. As a result, traffic at e-commerce sites rose more than 30% while conversion increased in a low single digit. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) comps surged 37% (or an increase of 39% in constant dollars) in the fiscal fourth quarter. E-commerce contributed $344 million or nearly 30% to total sales in the fiscal fourth quarter.

Moreover, e-commerce penetration reached 26% in fiscal 2018, ahead of the targeted 25% for fiscal 2020. With continued progress on e-commerce strategy, it remains on track to deliver $4 billion in revenues by 2020.

The company also has an unmatched level of opportunity to expand square footage and enhance business globally. It remains focused on expanding operations outside the United States and Canada, particularly in the underpenetrated Europe and Asia markets. This is evident from total market growth of more than 70% and nearly 60% recorded in Asia and Europe, respectively, in the fiscal fourth quarter. Particularly, the company witnessed solid e-commerce growth in China, wherein revenues improved 140% in the fiscal fourth quarter and 150% for fiscal 2018. Apart from China, lululemon's growth efforts in Asia were quite evident from the opening of its first store in Osaka, Japan, and its first airport store in Hong Kong.

In Europe, the company's brand is resonating well with customers. It attracted guests in Berlin with a new store in the Mitte district. Additionally, it opened the first store in Amsterdam. Moreover, lululemon plans to expand digital reach in international markets with the launch of local sites in Japan, France and Germany. Overall, the company plans to expand the international base by opening 25-30 stores in fiscal 2019.

These efforts place the company on track to attain the target of doubling revenues to about $4 billion, with earnings growth of more than double. Further, it expects e-commerce to account for more than one-third of sales by 2020.

Notably, in fiscal 2018, the company accomplished three of the targets for fiscal 2020, two years ahead of the plan. Operating margin in fiscal 2018 was 21.5%, gross margin was just over 55% and e-commerce penetration improved to 26% (a notch higher than the targeted 20-25% penetration by 2020). This clearly shows that lululemon is likely to successfully deliver on its goals for fiscal 2020, reflecting consistent growth and improved profitability. The company is likely to provide additional growth plans for the next five years at its Analyst Meet to be held in April 2019.

590," On the lookout for a Muni - Bonds fund? Starting with T. Rowe Price Tax Free High Yield Retail (PRFHX) should not be a possibility at this time. PRFHX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance. Objective Zacks categorizes PRFHX as Muni - Bonds, which is a segment packed with options. Muni - Bonds funds invest in debt securities issued by states or local municipalities. These are generally used to finance construction of infrastructure, pay for schools, or other government functions. Some are backed by taxes (revenue bonds), while others are "" general obligation "" and may not be backed by a defined source. Investors usually appreciate the tax benefits that come with many municipal bonds, which are especially impressive for those in high tax brackets. History of Fund/Manager T. Rowe Price is based in Baltimore, MD, and is the manager of PRFHX. T. Rowe Price Tax Free High Yield Retail debuted in March of 1985. Since then, PRFHX has accumulated assets of about $4.78 billion, according to the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by James M. Murphy who has been in charge of the fund since January of 2001. Performance Obviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. PRFHX has a 5-year annualized total return of 4.76% and is in the top third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 3.14%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame. When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of -22.69%, the standard deviation of PRFHX over the past three years is 3.57%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 3.28% compared to the category average of -3.57%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade. Bond Duration Modified duration is a measure of a given bond's interest rate sensitivity, so when judging how fixed income securities will respond in a shifting rate environment, it is an excellent figure to look at. If you believe interest rates will rise, this is an important factor to look at. PRFHX has a modified duration of 7.16, which suggests that the fund will decline 7.16% for every hundred-basis-point increase in interest rates. Income Income is often a big reason for purchasing a fixed income security, so it is important to consider the fund's average coupon. This metric takes a look at the average payout by the fund in a given year. For example, this fund's average coupon of 5.3% means that a $10,000 investment should result in a yearly payout of $530. While a higher coupon is good for when you want a strong level of current income, it could present a reinvestment risk if rates are lower in the future when compared to the initial purchase date of the bond. Income is only one part of the bond picture, investors also need to consider risk relative to broad benchmarks. PRFHX carries a beta of 1.05, meaning that the fund is more volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. With this in mind, it has a positive alpha of 1.14, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Ratings However, it is worth noting that 23 % of the bonds in this fund are not ranked, so take the average quality level with a bit of caution. Expenses As competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, PRFHX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.72% compared to the category average of 0.30%. From a cost perspective, PRFHX is actually more expensive than its peers. While the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500, investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100. Bottom Line Overall, T. Rowe Price Tax Free High Yield Retail ( PRFHX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, strong performance, worse downside risk, and higher fees compared to its peers.

591," Government Mortgage - Intermediate fund seekers should consider taking a look at Wells Fargo Coreblder Shares Series M (WFCMX). WFCMX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on nine forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance. Objective We classify WFCMX in the Government Mortgage - Intermediate category, an area full of potential choices. Government Mortgage - Intermediate funds focus on the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market, which packages mortgages together and then sells off the pooled securities as a MBS. Honing in on MBS'that have at least three years to maturity but less than 10, this fund category presents a medium risk and yield profile. History of Fund/Manager Wells Fargo is responsible for WFCMX, and the company is based out of San Francisco, CA. The Wells Fargo Coreblder Shares Series M made its debut in February of 2009 and WFCMX has managed to accumulate roughly $676.80 million in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals. Performance Obviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 4.62%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 3.29%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame. Bond Duration Modified duration is a measure of a given bond's interest rate sensitivity, so when judging how fixed income securities will respond in a shifting rate environment, it is an excellent figure to look at. If you believe interest rates will rise, this is an important factor to look at. WFCMX has a modified duration of 6.31, which suggests that the fund will decline 6.31% for every hundred-basis-point increase in interest rates. Income It is important to consider the fund's average coupon because income is often a big reason for purchasing a fixed income security. Average coupon is a look at the average payout by the fund in a given year. For example, this fund's average coupon of 4.63% means that a $10,000 investment should result in a yearly payout of $463. If you are looking for a strong level of current income, a higher coupon is a good choice, though it could pose a reinvestment risk; these risks can occur if rates are lower in the future when compared to the initial purchase date of the bond. Since income is just one part of the bond picture, investors need to consider risk relative to broad benchmarks. With a beta of 0.99, this fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, WFCMX has a positive alpha of 2.49, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Ratings Investors should also consider a bond's rating, which is a grade ( 'AAA' to 'D' ) given to a bond that indicates its credit quality. With this letter scale in mind, WFCMX has 23.05% in high quality bonds rated at least 'AA' or higher, while 55.51% are of medium quality, with ratings of 'A' to 'BBB'. The fund has an average quality of A, and focuses on high quality securities. Expenses For investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, WFCMX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0% compared to the category average of 0.06%. From a cost perspective, WFCMX is actually cheaper than its peers. Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.

595," By Ahmed Elumami and Ayman al-Warfalli TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya, April 5 (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan troops commanded by Khalifa Haftar said on Friday they had advanced into the southern outskirts of the capital Tripoli in a dangerous thrust against the internationally recognised government. Fighting was going on near the former international airport, which Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) force controlled by nightfall, an LNA spokesman and residents said. It came as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres departed after meeting Haftar to try to avert civil war. ""I leave Libya with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli,"" he said on Twitter. The U.N. Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on the latest developments on Friday and expressed deep concern in a statement read after the meeting by German U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, president of the council for April. ""They (the council) called on LNA forces to halt all military movements. They also called on all forces to de-escalate and halt military activity. There can be no military solution to the conflict,"" Heusgen said. Haftar, 75, who casts himself as an opponent of Islamist extremism but is viewed by opponents as a new Gaddafi, was quoted by Al-Arabiya TV as telling Guterres the operation would continue until terrorism was defeated. The coastal capital Tripoli is the ultimate prize for Haftar's eastern parallel government. In 2014, he assembled former Gaddafi soldiers and in a three-year battle seized the main eastern city of Benghazi. This year, he took the south with its oilfields. As well as visiting Haftar in Benghazi, Guterres had been in Tripoli this week to help organise a national reconciliation conference planned for later this month. But that plan looked in jeopardy on Thursday as LNA forces took Gharyan, about 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital after skirmishes with forces allied to Tripoli-based, U.N.-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. From there, Haftar's forces moved north, first taking the village of Suq al-Khamis, about 40 km (25 miles) from Tripoli, after some fighting, a resident and an eastern military source said. Then on Friday, the LNA said it took the areas of Qasr ben Ghashir and Wadi al-Rabie on the southern outskirts of the capital, seizing the former Tripoli International Airport, which has been abandoned since a 2014 battle.  SETBACK TO MEDIATION PLAN The LNA was in control of the former airport, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said, rejecting a claim by the Tripoli interior minister, Fathi Bashagha, that his forces had retaken it. The LNA said it had lost five soldiers since Thursday. While the advance has looked fast, so far Haftar's force has mainly crossed sparsely populated areas after taking Gharyan, the last town in the mountains before the road descends to a coastal plain. In 2014 battles for Tripoli, it took advancing fighters weeks to reach the city centre from the old airport as snipers bogged them down. Forces from Misrata, a city east of Tripoli, sent more reinforcements to defend Serraj, residents said. Major ministries are still 20 km away. Despite their gains, Haftar's forces failed to take a checkpoint about 30 km west of the capital in a bid to close the coastal road to Tunisia. An LNA-allied armed group withdrew overnight from so-called Gate 27, leaving it abandoned in the morning, a Reuters reporter said. And in another setback, forces allied to Tripoli took 145 LNA fighters prisoner in Zawiya, west of the capital, a western commander, Mohamed Alhudair, told Reuters. An LNA source confirmed 128 had been captured. Armed groups allied to the Tripoli government have moved more machinegun-mounted pickup trucks from the coastal city of Misrata to Tripoli to defend it against Haftar's forces. The offensive is a setback for the United Nations and Western nations trying to mediate between Serraj, 59, who comes from a wealthy business family, and military veteran Haftar. They met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss power-sharing. The United Nations wants to find agreement on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya, an oil producer and transit point for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara with the aim of reaching Europe. Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see him as a bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily, according to U.N. reports. The UAE, however, joined Western countries in expressing its deep concern about the fighting. Russia said it was not helping Haftar's forces and it supported a negotiated political settlement that ruled out any new bloodshed. Tunisia has tightened control on its border with Libya in response to the renewed conflict, the defence ministry said. Former colonial power Italy, which lies across the Mediterranean and has been a destination for migrants, was very worried, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said. ""We need to throw water on the fire, not petrol on the fire. I hope that people, acting out of economic or business self-interest, are not looking for a military solution, which would be devastating,"" Salvini said. ",24.17999999999938,1

598," By Michael Nienaber BERLIN, April 5 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will urge financial leaders next week to strive for a minimum level of corporate taxation globally and increase debt transparency in developing countries, a senior German government official said on Friday. The talks in Washington will be dominated by political risks such as trade disputes and Britain's departure from the European Union, said the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""This won't happen rapidly, this will happen step by step,"" the official said. Germany expects its current account surplus, by far the largest in the world, to shrink to the equivalent of 6.8 percent of its economic output next year from 7.3 percent this year. Finance ministers and central bank governors of the world's 20 biggest economies are due to meet in Washington next week with the state of the global economy and political risks to growth at the top of the agenda. In a preview of the April 12-14 IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Tuesday that global growth has lost momentum amid rising trade tensions and tighter financial conditions. Scholz sees a minimum level of corporate taxation globally as an important step to prevent digital companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon from booking profits in low-tax countries rather than where their customers are located. The government official said that the talks in Washington should bring progress on this front and that Scholz hoped for an agreement among the members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by mid-2020. Scholz is also expected to urge China and other countries to share more information about their lending in other countries to increase debt transparency. China has become one of the largest lenders in emerging markets, but it is not a member of the Paris Club of government creditors. ",24.17999999999938,1
599," By Prudence Ho and Jonathan Schwarzberg GLOBAL GIC and CPPIB have joined PE firms to bid for Ultimate Software In the most recent high profile example, a consortium led by private equity firm Hellman & Friedman has made a US$11bn cash offer to buy Nasdaq-listed Ultimate Software. Apart from Blackstone and JMI Equity as co-investors in the buying group, other parties include Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and Canada's biggest pension fund Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. According to Prequin, private equity-backed buyout deals involving pension and sovereign wealth funds were up 42% in 2018 to US$68.5bn from US$48.2bn in 2017. They included last year's biggest buyout, the US$20bn acquisition of Refinitiv by Blackstone, GIC and CPPIB, as well as the jumbo €10bn purchase of Akzo Nobel's chemical business by Carlyle and GIC. On Ultimate Software, the strong investor line-up allows the Hellman-led consortium to place a big equity contribution of more than 70% of the deal size. That's higher than the latest average equity contribution of around 40% in the US, according to LPC data. Ultimate Software is raising a US$2.3bn term loan, a US$275m revolving credit facility and an up to US$900m second-lien loan, which will be provided by direct lenders Ares and GSO. Large equity cheques allow private equity sponsors to compete better against cash-rich corporate buyers, to avoid concentration risks in a particular firm or sector, and to pursue bigger deals thanks to the record high dry powder available. ""They're able to move quickly and the costs are coming down,"" a banker said. ""Big pockets are out there and that will help get those transactions done."" In addition, it helps private equity firms to keep a strong relationship with the cash-rich pension and sovereign wealth funds, which are also limited partners (LPs), or investors, in their funds. ""LPs are very hungry,"" said Faisal Ramzan, London-based partner at law firm Proskauer Rose. ""Strong LPs will try to make it a condition of their investments into PE funds that they will be given co-investment opportunities."" By investing in deals directly, LPs could also save on fees, a second banker said. Pension and sovereign wealth funds have been expanding dramatically in recent years. CPPIB's investment partnerships portfolio that includes investments in hedge funds and private equity funds, as well as co-investments, ballooned to C$94.4bn (US$70.7bn) in the fiscal year of 2018 from C$77.8bn a year earlier. GIC increased its private equity investments to 11% of its portfolio from 9% during the same period, according to the funds' latest annual reports.  SITTING IN THE BACKSEAT CPPIB and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan have made a US$3.4bn offer for the satellite operator Inmarsat with private equity firms Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus on an equal equity basis. However, lenders still rely heavily on private equity sponsors rather than the pensions or sovereign wealth funds, despite their growing influence. ""Pension and wealth funds are investors only. They never want to be in the driving seat,"" a third banker said. ""I rely heavily on private equity sponsors for delivering investment strategy and creating value to grow a business."" Pension and sovereign wealth fund LPs normally reach an agreement to give PE sponsors voting power on their behalf on management and operational decisions. ""It's a proxy. Basically they are saying whatever you do, I will follow you,"" said Alexander Griffith, a partner at Proskauer Rose, adding there could be some exceptional matters and actions such as an increase of equity input or material decision being made that LPs might want to actively engage in.

600," By Aditya Kalra and Aditi Shah NEW DELHI, April 5 (Reuters) - Lessors to Jet Airways Ltd are planning to ask India's aviation regulator to de-register many more planes leased to the airline, three sources said, signalling a planned bailout of the debt-laden carrier is failing to assuage their concerns. About six lessors are expected to apply to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to de-register up to 15 planes that have already been grounded, over the next 10 days, one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Once de-registered, lessors can take the plane out of the country and lease them to other airlines. While some lessors have already taken their planes out after a mutual agreement with Jet, sources say the latest applications to do so are on a non-consensual basis. This deepens the crisis for Jet that has had to ground more than three-quarters of its fleet of 119 planes, many due to non-payment to lessors, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations. It was not immediately clear which of its lessors were planning to apply for de-registration in the coming days. About 100 of Jet's 119 mainly Boeing planes are leased by companies such as Avolon, GE Capital Aviation Services and AerCap Holdings. Avolon, one of the world's biggest aircraft lessors, on Thursday applied to the DGCA to take two of its planes placed with Jet outside of India, making it the first to pull planes out on a non-consensual basis. ""The lessors are really hassled,"" said one of the sources, declining to be identified as the discussions were private. ""Nobody wants to take risks."" Jet, India's oldest private carrier now controlled by its lenders, did not respond to requests for comment. Reflecting the overall risk-off sentiment, Indian Oil halted jet fuel supplies to the airline from Friday noon, saying it hopes to soon resolve payment issue with Jet. Jet shares ended down 1.6 percent in a positive Mumbai market.  DOWN TO THE WIRE India is keen to save Jet to prevent thousands of job losses, which could potentially dent sentiment days ahead a federal election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to secure a second term. Jet's lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), last month agreed to bailout the airline in a complex deal that involved the banks taking a majority stake in the company, while they continue looking for a new investor, and providing a fresh loan of $218 million. The lenders said late on Thursday they intended to push forward with their plan but offered no clarity on the interim funding. Some lessors have been sceptical about whether this proposed bailout can clear their dues on time. Several have not been paid for five to six months, a source has told Reuters. ""It's getting down to the wire. If nothing comes out by next week, I think it's done,"" said another source. After Kingfisher Airlines' disorderly collapse in 2012, India modified rules in line with the Cape Town convention, an international treaty that makes it easier for foreign lessors to repossess aircraft during payment defaults. In theory, lessors have the option to file a complaint with the DGCA, which in turn can cancel a plane's registration within five working days. But this is subject to some conditions such as clearing dues owed to airport operators, fuel vendors, tax authorities and other private entities. The government also needs to revise some local laws that conflict with the full implementation of the convention, making it a more complicated process in India than in some other countries.

601," By Cate Cadell BEIJING, April 5 (Reuters) - Chinese technology workers are protesting online against gruelling overtime hours at some companies, a rare push back against the work culture in the country's tech industry. The posts on Microsoft's GitHub, which calls itself the world's largest code host, and other programming tools have gone viral amid large-scale layoffs in the sector. An anonymous activist launched project ""996.ICU"" on GitHub last week where workers share examples of excessive overtime and vote for the top blacklisted companies as well as firms with better working conditions. ""What's the difference between these 996 companies and the old landlords who oppressed peasants???"" said one post. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, JD.com Inc and drone maker DJI Technology Co Ltd were among the blacklisted firms. Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday, a public holiday in China. A DJI spokesman said the company does not discuss specific employment issues, but it has ""a firm commitment to treating our employees with the highest respect and providing a healthy working environment."" A spokesman for JD.com declined to comment. ""996.ICU"" was Github's most book-marked project on Friday with over 176,000 followers. The campaign against 996 work culture went viral on Weibo, drawing thousands of responses on China's version of Twitter. Some locally developed browsers this week barred access to the anti-996 GitHub repository, citing legal reasons. The anti-996 campaign is the latest example of activists demanding better work conditions and supporting calls for greater union representation at a time of slowing economic growth. Katt Gu, law and regulatory consultant at Shanghai-based tech startup Dimension, called the 996 campaign a turning point. ""It's a time to punish those big evil companies who are not protecting their employees' rights,"" she said. Gu and Dimension chief executive Suji Yan have published an ""Anti-996"" open source license which would potentially bar a company from accessing open source software if it did not comply with local labour laws. They said the license would be tough to enforce, but could give employees a new way to raise concerns about working conditions. ""The programmer group is very civilised and educated,"" Gu said, adding they did not have political goals. ""It's really a tender and soft way, and an effective way to fight for their rights.""

604," By Fransiska Nangoy and Wilda Asmarini JAKARTA, April 5 (Reuters) - Indonesia's first plant to produce battery-grade nickel chemicals is on track to start operations by 2020, though the project still needs an environmental permit that could take up to eight months to be approved, the developer told Reuters. China'sTsingshan Group and partners including GEM Co Ltd are building a $700 million high pressure acid leaching (HPAL) plant at the PT Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) on Indonesia's Sulawesi island, a nickel mining hub. Nonetheless, some analysts have cast doubt on the ambitious timeline for the HPAL facilities, which are more complicated than other nickel-processing plants that Tsingshan has built. ""We are building it fast because that it is how we model our business to avoid higher costs, and we need also to catch up with the market,"" Alexander Barus, coordinating executive director of IMIP, said in an interview. IMIP is also a minor stakeholder in the plant. He said construction was currently at the excavation stage and the company is preparing an environmental impact assessment, known locally as AMDAL, which typically takes around six to eight months. ""This is something that we cannot rush,"" he said, adding construction would proceed as soon as the developer gets a green light from Indonesia'sEnvironment Ministry. According to initial research, it should be possible to neutralise waste, known as tailings, and remove toxic materials so that it can be safely disposed of, Barus said. ""Whether it will be an above-ground tailings or otherwise, we have to wait for the result,"" Barus said. Ary Sudijanto, an official at Indonesia'sEnvironment Ministry who oversees AMDAL proposals, said the ministry had not yet received a request from the Morowali plant.  SPRAWLING INDUSTRIAL PARK At the plant in the 2,000-hectare (4,900-acre) industrial park, Tsingshan and its partners aim to produce 131,000 tonnes of nickel sulphate crystals, 13,000 tonnes of cobalt sulphate crystals, and 27,000 tonnes of manganese sulphate crystals per year, he said. The industrial park already has nearly 30 jetties operating, giving it a shipping capacity nearly as big as Jakarta's main port, Tanjung Priok, he said. The park has 1,245 megawatts (MW) of power installed and an additional two 350-MW coal power plants are currently being constructed. Tsingshan is already a substantial miner and processor of nickel ore, converting it to nickel pig iron (NPI) to feed a stainless steel mill in Morowali. The company is also building a carbon steel plant. Indonesia has rich nickel reserves of around 3.5 billion wet tonnes, with around 60 percent of them low-grade laterite ore, Barus said. ""This is good for Indonesia because up to now we haven't used the low-grade ore,"" he said. Barus said he expects there to be more HPAL plants to be built at the estate once the first is ""on solid ground"". Indonesia's nickel industry in the next decade could surpass the value of its second-biggest export earner, palm oil, as new investment boosts capacity, Thomas Lembong, head of the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board, told Reuters in March. Exports from the HPAL plant are expected to be worth around $800 million a year and will mainly go to China, Barus said, though the government is hoping Indonesia will eventually create its own downstream industry. ""It will be good if we can be produce (batteries) ourselves, since the only component that is not produced here is lithium,"" he said. Indonesia, the second-largest car producer in Southeast Asia after Thailand, announced plans this year to introduce a fiscal scheme that will offer tax cuts to EV battery producers and automakers. Indonesia aims for 20 percent of vehicles produced in the country to be EVs and is anticipating investment from carmakers from South Korea, Japan, China and Europe. ",24.17999999999938,1

SMART Global operates throughout the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Disappointing Q2 Earnings While earnings of 77 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents, EPS declined considerably from the year-ago quarter; Q2 2018 earnings were $1.64 per share. Revenues of $304 million missed our consensus estimate and declined 3.2% year-over-year due to weakness in the company's Brazil business. Net sales in SMART Global's Brazil segment fell 29.5% year-over-year to $147.1 million on a ""worsening price environment"" for smartphone and PC commodity memory products. However, SGH's specialty memory segment saw sales increase nearly 10% from the year-ago quarter to $115.6%. And to its acquisition of Penguin Computing last summer, the company's specialty compute and storage solutions segment posted sales of $41.3 million. On top of these weak results was a weak outlook for SGH's third quarter. SMART Global expects net sales between $260 million and $270 million and adjusted earnings in the range of 34 cents and 38 cents per share.

607," By Reuters staff CAIRO, April 5 (Reuters) - Mohamed Abu Amer, a landscape gardener, was working in downtown Cairo when national security agents took him away on Feb. 6, 2018, his family said. For almost six months Amer's family waited for news of the 37-year-old father of two. Their messages to the Public Prosecutor and the Interior Ministry, which oversees the police and the national security agency, went unanswered. It's a version of events his family doesn't buy. Amer was no terrorist and he died in the custody of the state, not in a gun battle, his relatives insist. ""I know that what they are saying is untrue,"" said a relative. ""He was with them for six months."" Amer was one of 465 men killed in what the Interior Ministry said were shootouts with its forces over a period of three and a half years, a Reuters analysis of Interior Ministry statements has found. The announcements reviewed by Reuters appeared on the ministry's social media or were published by the state news agency. The killings began in the summer of 2015. In June that year, Islamist militants had assassinated Egypt's chief prosecutor, Hisham Barakat, an ally of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Sisi responded with a sweeping anti-terrorism law that shielded the police and military from prosecution for the proportionate use of force. Human rights groups say it was the start of a brutal crackdown. A researcher at an Egyptian organization that documents human rights abuses said police embarked on a spate of ""extra judicial killings knowing that no one will hold them accountable."" In 108 incidents involving 471 men, only six suspects survived, according to Interior Ministry statements from July 1, 2015 to the end of 2018. That represents a kill ratio of 98.7 percent. Five members of the security forces were killed, the statements said. Thirty seven were injured. The Interior Ministry issued crime scene photographs with some of the statements. They showed bloodied bodies with assault rifles or shotguns on the ground beside them. Almost all of the statements said arms and ammunition were recovered at the scene. Some said Islamic State flyers were found. But in interviews with Reuters, the relatives of 11 of the dead men contradicted the official accounts. Their sons, brothers or husbands had been plucked by police or national security agents from the streets or their homes and disappeared, they said, in some cases for several months. Then came news of their deaths in an Interior Ministry Facebook post or statement. The families said none of the young men carried arms. But some were supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, a movement that was outlawed in 2013 after Sisi led the military in toppling Egypt's first Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Mursi. Reuters showed three forensic experts mortuary images of two of the 11 dead men. These specialists cast doubt on the Interior Ministry's account of the two men's deaths. Three witnesses to one deadly encounter - the shooting of two members of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Kamal and Yasser Shehata, in a Cairo apartment block in 2016 - disputed the Interior Ministry's report of a gun battle with its forces. There was no exchange of fire or gun fight, these witnesses said. The U.S. State Department's latest annual report on human rights in Egypt, released in March, said abuses included arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government or its agents, forced disappearances and torture. The United States, nevertheless, has unfrozen $195 million in military aid to Egypt which it had previously withheld in part because of concerns over Egypt's human rights record. U.S. officials reason that security cooperation with Egypt is important to U.S. national security. Kate Vigneswaran, senior legal adviser at the International Commission of Jurists' Middle East and North Africa programme, said the killings described by Reuters could ""constitute extrajudicial executions, a serious crime under international law."" Evidence that victims were shot at close range would ""indicate that the use of lethal force was not a response to a legitimate threat, but rather premeditated and deliberate conduct by the security forces to execute individuals outside the protection of the law."" Kevin Jon Heller, associate professor of public international law at Amsterdam University, said if the victims were civilians, ""this would be the classic crime against humanity of murder: killing civilians as part of a widespread or systematic attack."" The Egyptian government didn't respond to questions for this article. Reuters provided officials with a detailed account of its analysis of the Interior Ministry statements and other findings of this article. They had no comment.  A ROAD TRIP Cousins Souhail Ahmed and Zakaria Mahmoud had no connection with the Muslim Brotherhood or any political organization, their family said. In July 2017 the men, both in their twenties, set off from their homes in the Nile city of Damietta for a holiday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh. The 600 km road trip would take them southwards from Damietta, close to the Mediterranean, along the Suez Canal and then the Gulf of Suez. For Ahmed, a student, it was a rare adventure. Hurt in a car crash a few years earlier, he still walked with a limp and stayed at home much of the time, a relative said. Ahmed called home a few hours into the trip and told his mother that they had stopped to get sugarcane juice as they headed for a checkpoint in Ismailia province, on the Suez Canal. It was the last time the family heard from them. Five days later, the Interior Ministry announced in a Facebook post that the cousins were among four Islamist militants killed in a shootout when security forces approached their hideout in an Ismailia village on July 15. Relatives found the bodies of the men at a mortuary in the town of Ismailia the next day. The families of the two young men say the government's version of events makes no sense. ""They are not Brotherhood supporters at all,"" said the relative. They ""were not supporters of anyone."" Ahmed ""was like all young men, he dreamed to marry at a young age and have a family."" Mahmoud was a carpenter. Reuters showed photographs and video of the bodies to three forensic experts - Professor Derrick Pounder, a pathologist who has consulted for Amnesty International and the United Nations, and two other international experts who declined to be identified. All three cast doubt on the Interior Ministry's account that the deaths were the result of a shootout. Mahmoud had three gunshot wounds to the head. One bullet entered beside his right nostril and exited just below his lower lip. ""That would place the shooter overlooking, above and to the right of the victim if the victim was standing, which would seem unlikely in an exchange of gunfire,"" Pounder said. ""A more likely scenario is that the victim was kneeling with the shooter standing close on the right side."" The two other gunshot wounds were to Mahmoud's forehead, almost symmetrically placed just below the hairline to the left and right, which suggested final ""coup de grace shots,"" according to Pounder. Authorities said in the statement the cousins were part of a ""group of fugitive terrorists"" and died in a single incident. ""As soon as security forces approached them, they were surprised by gunshots in their direction which they dealt with, resulting in the killing of four terrorist elements,"" the Interior Ministry said. Yet the cousins' bodies exhibited different stages of decomposition. Mahmoud's death appeared to have been very recent, the experts said, but Ahmed had died 36 to 48 hours before the images were taken. There were no obvious ante mortem injuries or gunshot wounds to Ahmed's body and no obvious cause of death, Pounder said.  ""THERE WAS NO SHOOTOUT"" From July 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2018, the Interior Ministry issued statements reporting the deaths of 465 men, almost all of them suspected militants, in gun battles with its forces. That compared with just five such deaths in the first half of 2015, before the murder of Barakat, the chief prosecutor. The Interior Ministry statements were strikingly similar. In every instance, the ministry said its forces approached or raided the hideout of the terrorists or criminals having secured an arrest warrant or taken ""all legal measures."" The terrorists or criminals opened fire, and security forces responded. Most of the dead men were in their 20s; the youngest was 16, the oldest was 61. The Interior Ministry classified 320 of the slain men as terrorists and 28 as criminals or drug dealers. It said 117 were members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood spread its political activism and charity work across the Middle East in the decades that followed. But in recent years countries including Egypt and Saudi Arabia have cracked down on its activities, declaring it a terrorist group. The Brotherhood, which insists it is a peaceful movement, has largely gone underground. Around a quarter of the deaths reported by the Interior Ministry, 104, were in the North Sinai region that borders Israel and Gaza, and where Egypt is battling an insurgency by Islamist militants. The Interior Ministry statements didn't name 302 of the dead men, nor did they give precise locations for many of the shootings. Many were in remote desert or mountain areas. Reuters managed to speak to three witnesses to one incident in a Cairo apartment in 2016. The Interior Ministry announced on Oct. 3, 2016, that its forces had killed a Muslim Brotherhood leader and his aide in a raid on the apartment. The ministry said Mohamed Kamal, 61, a member of the group's leadership council, and Yasser Shehata, 47, shot at police and died when officers returned fire. Reuters asked three neighbours about the events of that evening. None of them had seen or heard a gun fight. A woman living nearby said the only shots came several hours after police had entered the apartment. A person who was in the apartment block was adamant: ""There was no shootout."" A lawyer speaking on behalf of the two men's families told Reuters an official autopsy showed the two men were shot in the head. Reuters was not able to independently verify the autopsy conclusion. Some Interior Ministry statements were accompanied by crime scene photographs. These included the aftermath of a shooting in November 2018. The Interior Ministry said security forces killed 19 men in a shootout in the desert, west of Minya, Upper Egypt. The ministry said the dead were members of a cell responsible for a deadly attack on Christians two days earlier. Forensic expert Pounder reviewed 20 of the photographs. He said 11 of the bodies appeared to have been moved after death. He pointed to blood and drag marks in the sand. Depressions in the sand suggested two of the men were shot while in a kneeling position, he added. Photos of other bodies were inconclusive. An Egyptian judicial source said some police felt the courts were too slow, which led some officers to take justice into their own hands. ""They call it 'prompt justice,'"" he said. Police often moved weapons and other objects at the crime scene to cover up executions, the source said. ""The police are the ones who gather the information, and there is no way they will cooperate in collecting evidence that would incriminate their colleagues."" Reuters analysis of the Interior Ministry statements showed that deadly shootouts often followed an attack by Islamist militants. For example, in December 2018, a day after the deadly bombing of a Vietnamese tourist bus in Giza, the ministry announced that its forces had killed 40 people in three separate incidents. Gamal Eid, a human rights lawyer and founder of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information, said Egypt was trapped in a lethal cycle of extrajudicial killings and revenge attacks. ""The more extrajudicial killings take place, the more there will be desire for revenge,"" he said. A member of the state-funded National Council of Human Rights, George Ishak, said: ""There is a state of panic because of terrorism, but it shouldn't be like this. This fear has to stop.""  A VERDICT OVERTURNED In 2013, Khaled Emam, a 37-year-old weightlifting trainer, was sentenced in absentia to one year in jail for taking part in anti-government protests, his family said. To avoid arrest, he moved with his wife and two sons into an apartment in Cairo's southeastern Mokattam district, away from the family home. Emam was snatched from the street in June, 2017, his family said, when he was fetching medicine for one of his sons. Witnesses told his family that masked men leaped from a minibus and grabbed him. The family filed a complaint with the local police and wrote to the authorities asking for information. They got no response. Then, on Oct. 2, 2017, the Interior Ministry issued a statement that its forces had killed three men in a shootout in a graveyard. It named two of them - both friends of Emam. Two security sources confirmed to Reuters that Emam was also killed. At Cairo's Zeinhom mortuary, a relative found his body. It was bruised and showed signs of torture, the relative said. ""There were injuries around his joints, his arms were detached from his shoulders. Half of his lower jaw was missing along with several of his upper teeth."" One week after Emam's death, an appeals court overturned the guilty verdict and his one-year jail term, the relative said. The family hasn't filed a complaint about Emam's death for fear of reprisal. ""I know that I will not get justice,"" the relative said.  For a web version ",24.17999999999938,1

611," By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 5 (Reuters) - Central European currencies diverged on Friday, with the forint and zloty falling while the crown and the leu rose, amid mixed signals on the region's economic growth outlook. Hungary's industrial output and Czech retail sales grew faster than expected in February, underpinning expectations that the region's economies continue to expand robustly. While domestic consumption remains a strong driver of growth in the region, investors have looked with growing concern at weak data from the euro zone, Central Europe's main export market, in recent weeks. Hungary's central bank even dropped its hawkish bias last week, sending the forint into a fall, saying that incoming economic data would drive its policy moves. February data confirmed that industrial output remains healthy, analysts said. But the forint is still driven by positioning rather than by economic data, one Budapest-based dealer said. The forint continued to dance around the psychological level of 320 against the euro, and the jury is out whether it will again head towards multi-month lows beyond 322 or resistance levels around 318, market participants said. While the zloty also eased 0.1 percent, the crown and the leu touched two-week highs, posting minor gains. The Czech central bank said in minutes from its March 18 meeting that the prevailing view of its rate setters was of there being no need to rush any further interest rates hikes, following interest . But the consensus was that there was still room to increase rates, while the uncertainty surrounding the crown exchange rate remained high. A firmer crown would tighten monetary conditions, leading to less need to increase interest rates. According to a Reuters poll of analysts, the only currency in the regions that is expected to post meaningful gains over the next year is the crown. It is seen firming about 2 percent versus the euro. In Bucharest, the central bank said at its meeting on Tuesday that it would act to tighten money market liquidity while inflation remained above target. Tighter liquidity helps the leu which the bank keeps in a quasi managed float. The Bucharest overnight interbank rate was bid at 3.24 percent, staying near its highest levels in five years.

612," By Terje Solsvik and Gwladys Fouche OSLO, April 5 (Reuters) - Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will streamline its $300 billion fixed-income portfolio by cutting emerging market bonds from the benchmark index it tracks, the Finance Ministry said on Friday. Government and corporate bonds with a total value of $17 billion at the end of 2018 would be affected, according to a Reuters calculation based on fund data. ""Along with certain adjustments to the country weightings for government bonds, the changes proposed will facilitate lower transaction costs in the management of the Fund,"" it added. The fund will still be able to buy emerging market bonds if fund managers want to actively invest in them, rather than passively tracking the benchmark index, although such paper would be capped at five percent of the fixed-income portfolio. The Norwegian wealth fund, currently worth $1.05 trillion, invests around 30 percent of its assets in fixed income. The 70 percent invested in equities was not affected by the decision. In 2017, the central bank, which manages the fund, proposed cutting 20 currencies from the fixed-income benchmark, leaving only U.S. dollars, euros and British pounds. Friday's decision means Danish, Swedish, Swiss, Japanese, Canadian and Australian bonds will remain part of the benchmark, as will those of Singapore, New Zealand and Hong Kong.

614," By Ann Saphir April 4 (Reuters) - Former pizza chain executive Herman Cain, U.S. President Donald Trump's pick for a position on the Federal Reserve's interest-rate setting panel, runs a political fundraising group that has spent more than half its money supporting Trump's reelection. Cain, himself a former Republican presidential candidate and a long-time conservative activist, chairs America Fighting Back PAC, a political action committee created ""by a group of President Trump's most committed supporters,"" according to the group's website. Its mission is to fight ""disrespectful, dishonest and destructive news"" about Trump and bolster a movement of voters to fight for his reelection in 2020. Trump's plan to nominate an overt loyalist for a spot on the Fed board comes as Trump over and over again lambastes the central bank for raising interest rates four times last year and could checker the Fed's long-cherished standing as an independent, apolitical body. Moore is also a longtime Trump ally who has joined him in criticizing last year's rate hikes. Cain was a Republican candidate for president in 2012 before dropping out amid allegations by several women of sexual harassment, which he has vehemently denied. His America Fighting Back PAC has raised $347,000 during the current election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. At least $190,500 of that has gone to Canton, Ohio-based RRTV Media for television advertising in support of Trump, filings with the Federal Election Commission show. The total includes $10,000 just weeks before Cain met with Trump to discuss the Fed job on Jan. 30, and another $9,000 in early March. Cain appears to be the only one of Trump's Fed nominees so far to have actively raised funds for his benefit. He has not individually made any contributions to Trump's campaign. The White House declined comment. A campaign solicitation email signed by Cain was circulated on Feb. 5, less than a week after his interview with Trump. Reuters received a copy of the email directly. ""Friend, I couldn't stand to see our President and his family abused and attacked by the mainstream media and Washington swamp any longer,"" the email began. ""With the 2020 election on the horizon, please become a Founding Member with America Fighting Back PAC by making a contribution of $25, $50, $100, $500, or even $1000 to help us take on all the D.C. forces out to get President Trump,"" the email said. Floyd Brown, a conservative activist who co-chairs the PAC with Cain, said in an email that when Cain learned about Trump's interest in appointing him to the Fed, he voluntarily ""stepped away from day to day involvement with the PAC... (and) has let us know he will resign if nominated."" Brown said the Feb. 5 fundraising email was likely approved before Cain's meeting with Trump, after which ""he immediately ceased his efforts."" The PAC's TV ads were also changed to remove Cain from them, Brown said. Cain, whose Twitter feed continues to be chock full of partisan support for Trump and opposition to his Democratic rivals, did not respond to requests for comment.  POLICYMAKERS AND POLITICAL DONATIONS Fed officials assiduously guard their political independence, seen as crucial for its ability to steer the economy. Close ties with politicians have led central banks in other countries to keep monetary policy too loose, eventually stoking inflation. Trump has stridently criticized the Fed's interest rate hikes, saying they have hurt the economy. Cain's political fundraising could ignite criticism from legislators. The central bank's Washington-based board is picked by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The members of the Board of Governors and the president of the New York Fed are permanent voters on the U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee, while four of the remaining 11 presidents of the regional Fed banks serve on a rotating basis. In 2016 Fed Governor Lael Brainard drew fire from Republican lawmakers for donations to Democrat Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated to win the White House. Brainard's contributions eventually totaled $2,700, the maximum allowed under law. Donations to political candidates by sitting Fed governors are extremely rare, though they are generally allowed under rules which govern the political activities of top Fed officials and other federal employees. Soliciting political contributions is prohibited under those same rules. Four current Fed board members were appointed by Trump, including Chairman Jerome Powell, an appointment Trump apparently regrets. Trump's three other appointees are Randal Quarles, Richard Clarida and Michelle Bowman. Quarles has donated frequently to Republican candidates over the years. His most recent donation, according to the Federal Election Commission, was $35,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in November 2016. That was about seven months before he was picked by Trump for the Fed. Powell, who first became a Fed governor in 2016 as an appointee of President Barack Obama, has not made a federal political donation since 2008, when he gave $28,500 to the Republican National Committee. Bowman's most recent political donation was $500 to Republican Mitt Romney for his presidential run in 2012, FEC records show. Clarida gave $2,000 to George W. Bush in 2004 and has made no political donations since.  Additional reporting by Tim Ahmann, Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland in Washington, D.C. ",24.17999999999938,1
615," By Carolyn Cohn and Lawrence White LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Major financial services firms in Britain have made very little progress in narrowing the gap between male and female pay and more than a third have gone backwards, a Reuters analysis of gender pay data shows. Financial firms have on average reduced pay disparities by just over half a percentage point in the last year, the analysis of 89 of the biggest companies showed, highlighting the lack of progress in the sector with the worst average pay gap in Britain. Pay disparities in Britain have come under the spotlight since the government forced businesses to submit gender pay gap figures annually from last year. The data shows the difference between average hourly male and female pay, and tends to reflect the smaller number of women at senior levels, where financial services firms have a poor record. Reuters surveyed 89 major banks, asset managers, hedge funds, insurers and other financial services firms in Britain, including all the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 financial services firms that had reported gender pay data by Thursday. On average, the firms showed a narrowing in the mean gender pay gap of just 0.6 percentage points compared with a year earlier, the survey showed.  , who runs the government-backed Women in Finance charter, criticised finance firms for not doing enough. ""Businesses need to realise that they will not succeed unless they embrace diversity as a key driver of results and growth,"" she said. ""They need to focus on it, measure it, set targets and hold senior executives accountable for making progress - year in year out."" Virgin Money - which was bought by rival CYBG last year - had itself faced criticism for reporting a wide gender pay gap of 32.5 percent for 2017. The bank narrowed the gap to 29.7 percent last year. Only three firms had a gender pay gap below last year's mean national average. Fifteen of the 48 major British, U.S. and other international banks surveyed reported a widening in the gender pay gap of their UK employees, and 32 of all the firms did so. Firms with more than 250 employees in Britain had until April 5 to submit gender pay data, the second year of this government requirement. The overall mean hourly gender pay gap based on employers who reported in 2018 was 14.3 percent, according to government data, but that widened to 30 percent for the financial sector according to an Investment Association (IA) study published this week. In addition to a ""motherhood penalty"" and behavioural biases, the IA said that in financial services, there were ""limitations in real meritocracy"". HSBC had the biggest gender pay gap of the companies surveyed, at 61 percent, a widening of two percentage points from a year ago. ""We are committed to improving our gender balance and recognise that this will require sustained focus over the long-term,"" the bank said in a statement. It added it was taking a number of specific steps, including an ""aspirational target"" for 30 percent of senior leadership roles to be filled by women by 2020. On this measure, it said it had progressed from 22 percent in 2012 to 28.2 percent at the end of 2018. Within some of the companies looked at, individual operating units performed particularly badly. Across all the firms surveyed, State Street Global Advisors, the asset management arm of custody bank State Street, showed a year-on-year widening in the pay gap of 13.9 percentage points. The overall bank, though, saw a 0.1 percentage point reduction. ""While we have made significant on-going efforts to improve, we recognise that there is much more work to be done,"" a spokeswoman for State Street said. FTSE 100 asset manager Hargreaves Lansdown was most successful in narrowing its pay gap, more than halving it to 13.7 percent from 28.8 percent, which the firm attributed to hiring more women in its third to sixth tiers of seniority although it noted its median gap rose. Consumer credit firm Provident Financial's home credit division had the smallest gender pay gap, at 4.9 percent.  UK financial sector gender pay gap interactive ",24.17999999999938,1
616," By Jeffrey Dastin and Ross Kerber April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators shot down attempts by Amazon.com Inc to stop its investors from considering two shareholder proposals about the company's controversial sale of a facial recognition service, a sign of growing scrutiny of the technology. Decisions including one on Wednesday by officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed an unusual appeal by Amazon to block the non-binding proposals from being voted on at the company's upcoming annual meeting. Both proposals face uphill battles to receive a majority of support from investors in the world's largest online retailer and cloud computing company. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos will retain voting rights over about 16 percent of shares after he and MacKenzie Bezos divorce, she said on Thursday. Amazon declined to comment on the SEC decisions. The company is one of many marketers of facial recognition technology and has disclosed sales to law enforcement and to private customers using the service for purposes such as identifying celebrities. Civil liberties groups have raised concerns including findings by researchers that Amazon's technology struggles more than some peers' to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin, prompting fears of unjust arrests. Amazon has defended its work and said all users must follow the law. Michael Connor, executive director of Open MIC, an advocacy group working with shareholders, including a religious order, who brought the resolutions, said the SEC decisions show the developing rules around facial recognition are ""really a critical issue for a company like Amazon and how it handles the business risk associated with the technology."" According to correspondence posted on the SEC website, Amazon had sought the regulator's permission to skip the proposals as being insignificant to its business, among other things, but was turned down on March 28. Amazon then took the unusual step of asking for a reconsideration of that decision, but was again rebuffed in a April 3 letter from the agency. Other letters show the SEC gave Amazon permission to skip proposals for things like a risk oversight committee, and that Amazon resolved climate concerns raised by other investors.

618," By Tom Sims and John O'Donnell FRANKFURT, April 5 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will ask Deutsche Bank to raise fresh funds before it gives the go-ahead for a merger with a state-backed rival, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The official said that Deutsche would be required to have the buffer, which has yet to be calculated, to cope should it experience setbacks while integrating Commerzbank if a deal is agreed. Government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, have pushed for a merger to create a national banking champion and end questions over the banks' future. While Deutsche has argued the case that little or no capital may be needed, regulators, worried about the group's U.S. investment bank and the potential fallout of it failing a stress test there in September, are putting their foot down. The ECB and Commerzbank declined to comment. Deutsche Bank declined repeated requests for comment on Thursday. On Friday, a spokesman said that there was ""no basis"" for the assumption that the ECB would ask it to raise fresh funds. On the stress tests, the spokesman said Deutsche had invested heavily in data and model capabilities and would continue to do so. ""We believe we have made significant progress,"" he said. With much left to be negotiated in any deal, the size of a capital hole remains unclear but is expected to run into billions of euros. A merged entity could need up to 10 billion euros ($11.22 billion) of fresh capital because of restructuring costs and the fact that losses on investments could be triggered by a tie-up. Deutsche Bank's exploratory merger talks with Commerzbank come after prodding by Germany's finance ministry, which is worried about Deutsche's future. A deal would see Berlin become a shareholder in the combined group. Germany currently holds a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank after a bailout during the financial crisis. The banks announced on March 17 that they were in talks to merge and a preliminary decision on whether they want to go forward with a merger is expected within days. Deutsche Bank came under increased pressure on Thursday to move forward on a tie-up with Commerzbank after Italy'sUniCredit was named as a potential alternative bidder for the German lender. UniCredit could explore a merger with Commerzbank if talks with Deutsche fall through, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. A potential merger between Deutsche and Commerzbank has met stiff resistance from labour unions fearing jobs cuts, and from some major investors.

The finance ministry said it had received nearly 9 billion euros ($10.10 billion)-worth of requests for the bonds. It had offered750 million euros in six-year papers and 1.25 billion euro in 12-year notes, to be settled on April 11. A document issued by one of the banks leading the deal indicated that the bonds were priced on Thursday. Banca IMI, BNP Paribas, Natixis and Standard Chartered Bank are bookrunners for the offer. Officials say they are trying to diversify the country's sources of foreign debt and lengthen its average maturity and had previously raised the possibility of issuing bonds denominated in an Asian currency. In February, Egypt issued $4 billion in dollar-denominated bonds with maturities of five, 10 and 30 years.  ($1 = 0.8906 euros) ",24.17999999999938,1

Most drivers entering London's central zone, spanning King's Cross in the north, the City in the east, the Imperial War Museum in the south and Buckingham Palace in the west, pay 11.50 pounds ($15) Monday to Friday during the day. Private hire firms had been exempt from the charge but regulator Transport for London (TfL) is seeking to cut the number of vehicles on the British capital city's roads, which has surged partly due to burgeoning taxi apps.

621," By Tom Wilson LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Collective puzzlement has reigned among cryptocurrency analysts and traders since bitcoin's dramatic jump on Tuesday, with the mysterious spike shedding harsh light on flaws in a market the mainstream considers too opaque, too volatile and too risky. Bitcoin soared nearly 20 percent in its best day since the height of its 2017 bubble, lifting smaller cryptocurrencies and prompting analysts to scour blockchain records and social media for clues on the catalyst for the sudden move. Some put the move down to big-scale, anonymous buying that ignited a frenzy of computer-driven trading. Others cited an spoof article suggesting U.S. regulators would give the nod to bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds. Many simply shrugged: Just another day in the life of an emerging asset known throughout its first decade for its volatility. But the head-scratching was a reminder, if bigger investors needed one, of dysfunction in a market plagued by problems from thin liquidity and poor price discovery to unreliable data and an absence of fair value for major assets. ""The challenge is that it's a completely decentralised environment,"" said Obi Nwosu of the London-based Coinfloor exchange. ""There aren't tools in place to easily verify the quality of the data."" Bitcoin got close to $20,000 in December 2017 in a retail-led bubble that grabbed the attention of investors worldwide. But prices collapsed by three-quarters last year as regulators clamped down, usage of bitcoin stalled and interest waned. On Friday, bitcoin was last trading at around $4,900, as it held on to Tuesday's gains. Now at the wheel of crypto trading are niche hedge funds, wealthy individuals, and tech firms rooted in blockchain technology. Mainstream money, from pension funds to asset managers, is notable by its absence. ""These are very nascent markets,"" said David Mercer, CEO of LMAX Exchange Group, which runs FX and cryptocurrency exchanges. Angst over cybersecurity at trading venues and questions over regulators' stance gnaw at longer-term investors, but the character of the market remains a key block to its development. ""A lot of funds do have very strict mandates about where they are able to invest,"" said Steve Swain of Lendingblock, a securities lending platform for cryptocurrencies. ""That comes down to markets that are trustworthy, properly run and regulated."" ",24.17999999999938,1
622," By Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS, April 5 (Reuters) - The European Commission charged Valve, the owner of a video distribution platform, and five game publishers on Friday with preventing EU consumers from shopping around within the European Union to find the best deal for the games they offer. The case is the latest move by EU antitrust regulators against cross-border curbs on online trade, key to what is seen as a major part of economic growth in the 28-country bloc. ""In a true digital single market, European consumers should have the right to buy and play video games of their choice regardless of where they live in the EU,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. The Commission has sent what it calls a ""statement of objections"" to the companies, allowing them to reply and request hearings to present their arguments. Companies found guilty of anti-competitive behaviour can be fined up to 10 percent of their annual global turnover. The Commission said it was concerned that Valve and the five game publishers agreed to prevent cross-border sales by geo-blocking the 'activation keys' that enable consumers to be able to play games. This may have prevented consumers from buying cheaper games available in other EU countries. EU antitrust regulators opened its investigation in February 2017, at the same time also looking into online sales of electronics and hotel rooms. EU rules prohibit geographically based restrictions that undermine online shopping and cross-border sales. Last month, it fined Nike for blocking cross-border sales of soccer merchandise.

623," DUBAI, April 5 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has arrested eight people, including two dual U.S.-Saudi citizens, in an apparent crackdown on supporters of women activists whose trial has drawn Western condemnation, rights groups said on Friday. The 11 women on trial had campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom's male guardianship system. Their case has intensified criticism of Riyadh's rights record, already in the spotlight after last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The U.S. nationals are journalist Salah al-Haidar, whose mother Aziza al-Yousef is among those on trial, and Bader al-Ibrahim, a doctor and author of a book about Shi'ite Muslim politics, the associate and London-based Saudi rights group ALQST said. Five other people close to the women have also been placed under a travel ban since February, they added. An official from theU.S. State Department confirmed the arrest of two U.S. citizens and said it had ""engaged the Saudi government in this regard"", without providing details. The Saudi government communications office and the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh did not respond to requests for comment. Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International'sMiddle East research director, said the authorities were ""signalling to their entire people that there will be zero tolerance of any form of criticism, let alone questioning, of the state's authoritarian practices."" A Riyadh court last week temporarily released three of the women on trial, including Yousef, raising hopes of a more lenient handling after months of lobbying by Western governments. But the new arrests could signal that the authorities will resist international pressure and pursue harsh sentences.  TORTURE ALLEGATIONS Khashoggi's murder tarnished the reputation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who courted Western support for his efforts to modernise Saudi Arabia. The CIA and some Western countries believe he ordered the killing, which Saudi officials deny. Dozens of other activists, intellectuals and clerics have been arrested separately in the past two years in an apparent bid to stamp out opposition. The women on trial were arrested last May and branded as traitors. At least one of them has been charged under the kingdom's cybercrime law and faces up to five years in prison. Five men arrested at the same time are not on trial. Rights groups say two of them have been released, but the others' status is unclear. Another U.S.-Saudi national, Walid al-Fitaihi, has been detained since 2017 under Riyadh's anti-corruption campaign. His son told U.S. senators last month he had been tortured in detention, including electric shocks and whipping. Some of the women activists have also alleged torture and sexual assault, which the authorities deny. The siblings of one woman, Loujain al-Hathloul, who have publicised her case in U.S. media, say men describing themselves as ""close to the state"" had asked his parents to stop them from speaking out. ""We stayed silent for eight months. We thought that being silent would solve the issue,"" Walid al-Hathloul told CNN on Thursday. ""We found out at the end of the day that this made the case even worse and that's why we're speaking out now. At the end of the day we didn't have any options but to speak out.""

626," LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index will scale new peaks above 3,000 in the second quarter before topping out, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) said on Friday as data showed more cash was pulled from global equities this week. The forecast was published in the bank's weekly report on fund flows that showed investors continued to shun U.S. and European equities, pulling $7.7 billion from stocks in the week to April 3 and piled further into bond funds adding $11.4 billion. The report is based on EPFR data. That marked the 13th straight week of bond inflows as worries about the slowing global economy pushed investors into assets considered safe in times of economic and political strife. That contrasts with $2.6 billion out of European equities, $1.6 billion out of U.S. stocks. Technology was the only equity sector winner with $1 billion inflows, it said. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index hit record highs on Wednesday on hopes that Washington and Beijing are close to resolving their trade spat and bets that the drop in industry demand is close to bottoming out. The bank's strategists said they expect the U.S. stock market to peak in the current quarter after hitting all-time highs fuelled by gains in banks and oil stocks. A 3,000 level would mark a 4 percent rise from Thursday's close. The index touched a record high in September of 2,940. Global equities have been on a tear this year, bouncing back from the massive rout towards the end of 2018 after U.S. and European central banks took a more dovish stance on rate policy and on hopes of an imminent U.S.-China trade truce. The S&P500 has risen 23 percent so far this year. ",24.17999999999938,1
627," By Medha Singh and Agamoni Ghosh April 5 (Reuters) - European shares were flat on Friday as investors waited for concrete progress in trade talks between China and the United States ahead of a closely-watched U.S. jobs report. The pan-region STOXX 600 index was little changed at 0915 GMT, set for its best weekly rise in three weeks. German industrial output rose in February, some good news for Europe's largest economy while other data showed France's trade deficit narrowed in the same period. All eyes will now be on the U.S. non-farm payrolls report for March due later in the day, which is expected to show a recovery from February's 17-month low. ""It is the most important day when we speak of the economic data when investors get to see the health of the U.S. labour market. This particular number has the capacity to set the trading tone for the rest of the month,"" Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at TF Global Markets in London, wrote in a note. Earlier in the week upbeat factory data from China and Europe led equities to rally, somewhat mollifying investor concerns over global growth that have dominated world markets since late-last year. Hopes that the U.S.-China talks would yield a trade truce have been a major driver for European stocks this week with auto stocks leading the rally. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday a deal with China could be announced within four weeks. ""It is becoming increasingly more concrete and clear that both sides want to secure a deal, hence the optimism is advancing that the outcome of a signed trade deal is moving towards a matter of 'when' and not 'if',"" said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. More complications arose for a possible merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. The European Central Bank will ask Deutsche Bank to raise fresh funds before it gives the go-ahead for the deal, a source told Reuters. The demand could complicate a bid to create Europe's third-largest bank out of Germany's top two lenders, who have struggled to recover since the financial crisis. Commerzbank shares rose nearly 2 percent while those of Deutsche bank dipped. Hammerson Plc slipped and weighed down the midcap FTSE 250 after Stifel downgraded shares of the British shopping centre operator and Jefferies trimmed its price target.

629," By Ahmed Elumami and Ayman al-Warfalli TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya, April 5 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was flying to eastern Libya on Friday to meet commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces are advancing on the capital Tripoli now held by an internationally recognised government. Troops allied to the Tripoli government moved more vehicles from the western city of Misrata to Tripoli to defend the capital against Haftar's forces, who are allied to a parallel administraion in the east, residents said. They also surprised the United Nations, whose Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had been in Tripoli this week to help organize a reconciliation national conference later this month. Guterres, who spent the night in the heavily fortified U.N. compound in a Tripoli suburb, will also go to Tobruk, another eastern city, to meet lawmakers of the House of Representatives, also allied to Haftar. ""My aim remains the same: avoid a military confrontation. I reiterate that there is no military solution for the Libyan crisis, only a political one,"" Guterres wrote on Twitter. Late on Thursday, the assembly president, Aguila Saleh, issued a statement welcoming the offensive, a spokesman said. Since Gaddafi's downfall, the country has been divided between the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and the parallel administration allied to Haftar. Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) forces on Thursday took Gharyan, a city some 80 km (50 miles) south of Tripoli after brief skirmishes with forces allied to Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj. But the LNA did not succeed in taking a checkpoint west of the capital in a bid to close the coastal road to Tunisia, Tripoli's main artery. An armed group allied to the LNA withdrew overnight from the so-called Gate 27, 27 km west of Tripoli, which was abandoned in the morning, a Reuters reporter said. The renwed confrontation is a setback for the United Nations and Western countries which have been trying to mediate between Serraj and Haftar, who met in Abu Dhabi last month to discuss a power-sharing deal. The conference the United Nations is helping to organize is aimed at forging agreement on a road map for elections to resolve the prolonged instability in Libya, an oil producer and a hub for refugees and migrants trekking across the Sahara in the hope of reaching Europe. Haftar enjoys the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which see him as bulwark against Islamists and have supported him militarily, according to U.N. reports. Haftar's biggest opponent is Misrata, a western city that is home to strong forces which also have aircraft, analysts say. It is known for resisting old regime figures, including in 2011 when forces loyal to Gaddafi besieged it for three months. ",24.17999999999938,1

633," Social Security may be responsible for keeping more than 22 million people out of poverty each month, according to an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, but it's also a program that's on a collision course with disaster. In June 2018, the Social Security Board of Trustees released its annual report, as it's done for decades, on the near-term (10-year) and long-term (75-year) outlook for the program. Similar to every report since 1985 , the Trustees found that revenue generation would be insufficient to cover expenditures over the long term, suggesting that a benefits cut of up to 21% may be needed for then-current and future retirees by 2034.  Image source: Getty Images. But the 2018 report contained a new harbinger of danger. Namely, it forecast that 2018 (rather than 2022, as was cited in previous reports) would be the first year since 1982 in which Social Security's expenditures outpaced its revenue collection . Although the Trustees forecast a relatively small net cash outflow of $1.7 billion, which is peanuts compared to the nearly $2.9 trillion currently held in asset reserves, it represents a plain-as-day signal that the existing payout schedule is unsustainable. Not to mention, these net cash outflows are expected to dramatically grow in size over the coming years as demographic changes weigh on the program. Interestingly enough, this prediction didn't come to fruition . Investment holding data published monthly by the Social Security Administration -- the program's net cash is used to buy special-issue bonds -- shows that the aggregate investment holdings of the Old-Age and Survivors Trust (OASI) and Disability Insurance Trust (DI) (collectively known as the OASDI) rose just shy of $3.2 billion between the end of 2017 and the end of 2018. Although this was still the smallest net cash surplus since the Reagan administration passed the last sweeping overhaul of Social Security in 1983, it nonetheless pushed Social Security's unwanted inflection point out a bit further. However, the release of new data on Social Security's investment holdings should have working Americans and retirees alike very worried.  Image source: Getty Images. According to Social Security Administration data from the end of February 2019, the aggregate amount of OASDI asset reserves invested was $2,892,241,837,000. Over the two months between the end of 2018 and the end of February, the amount invested by the DI Trust rose ever so slightly, while the amount invested by the OASI, which handles retired worker and survivor benefits, declined by $3.23 billion. Again, we're not talking about a jaw-dropping cash outflow, but it does appear that, at least through the first two months of 2019, the unwanted Social Security inflection point has arrived. Namely, Social Security may be a cash-burning rather than a cash-surplus program moving forward. How's this possible? In addition to baby boomers retiring from the workforce in greater numbers, factors that include increased longevity, lower birth rates, growing income inequality, and lower interest rates that have led to less in the way of interest income collection have each played a role in weakening the Social Security program. Now, to be clear, this inflection point, should this net cash outflow remain steady throughout 2019, does not signify that Social Security is insolvent . Even if all of this excess cash were to disappear as predicted by 2034, Social Security would still be every bit as solvent then as it is now. That's because recurring sources of income, such as its 12.4% payroll tax on earned income and the taxation of Social Security benefits over select income thresholds, ensure that money keeps flowing into the program for disbursement to eligible beneficiaries. But, once again, this net cash outflow does signify the reality that the existing payout schedule isn't sustainable without raising additional revenue, cutting long-term expenditures, or finding a middle-ground solution that incorporates both fixes.  Image source: Getty Images. Arguably, the biggest problem isn't coming up with a solution on how best to tackle Social Security's estimated $13.2 trillion cash shortfall between 2034 and 2092. Rather, it comes down to how best to get Democrats and Republicans, who each believe they have the best solution , to work together on a middle-ground fix. Democrats have long favored an approach that leads to higher taxable revenue collection and more robust cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). They aim to accomplish this by raising or eliminating the payroll tax earnings cap, which sits at $132,900 in 2019. While most working Americans pay into Social Security on every dollar they earn, salary and wages above $132,900 are exempt. Democrats want to end this loophole by requiring the rich to pay more into the system, while at the same time utilizing the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) as the program's new inflationary tether. The CPI-E should lead to notably higher COLAs over the long run. Meanwhile, Republicans have proposed a gradual increase to the full retirement age and a switch to the Chained CPI as the program's inflationary tether. Instead of raising additional revenue, the GOP's approach would aim to reduce lifetime benefits for future generations of workers and lower annual COLAs over time, thereby saving Social Security money by lowering expenditures. Truth be told, each plan brings something to the table that the other lacks, and a bipartisan approach would be a considerably stronger long-term fix than a single-party solution. But even with Social Security's investment holdings data signifying that the program's unwanted inflection point may have arrived, getting our nation's lawmakers to play nice with each other and find a common-ground solution is easier said than done.

634," TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders likely rose for the first time in four months in February, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, but weak external demand and the U.S.-China trade war continue to cloud the outlook. Core machinery orders, a volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the following six to nine months, likely grew 2.5 percent in February from a month earlier, the poll of 17 economists showed. In January, orders dropped 5.4 percent from the previous month. ""Uncertainty over the economic outlook has risen globally and firms are cautious about investment, especially high-tech companies,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute. Compared with one year earlier, core orders in February are expected to have fallen 5.2 percent in February, according to the poll. The trade friction between the United States and China is a major risk for Japan, as it ships electronics parts and heavy machinery to China as well as makes finished products for the United States and other markets. The Cabinet Office will announce the machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. Wednesday, April 10, Tokyo time. The Reuters poll also showed an expectation that Japan's current account likely had a surplus of 2.68 trillion yen ($24.00 billion) in February after 600.4 billion yen in January. A weak yen likely inflated income from investments overseas, which contributed to a wider payments surplus, analysts said. The finance ministry will release the February current account balance at 8:50 a.m.Tokyo time on April 8. The poll also showed the Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, increased 1.1 percent in March from a year earlier, after a 0.8 percent gain in February. Price gains in oil-related items and chemical products lifted the index, analysts said.  ($1 = 111.66 yen) ",24.17999999999938,1
635," KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Reuters) - Other companies may be in the running to buy Australian rare-earths processing company Lynas Corp, which may lose the operating license for its processing plant in Malaysia, the country's Prime Minister said on Friday. Lynas operates an $800 million plant in the Malaysian town of Kuantan that refines ore from a rare-earths mine that it owns in Australia. Malaysia has recently halted the renewal of its operating license over concerns about how it handles radioactive wastes at the site. Lynas last week rejected a $1.1 billion takeover offer from Australian conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd though Wesfarmers said they remain keen on the talks. ""We have opened up the business to other people, and there are other companies willing to acquire Lynas,"" Mahathir said. Mahathir did not say who are the companies interested in purchasing Lynas. ""They have given us a promise that in the future before sending the raw materials to Malaysia they will clean it up first. They will crack it and decontaminated it in some way with regard to radioactivity,"" Mahathir said. He added that the company, or even Lynas, would be able to operate in Malaysia if they promise that raw materials coming to Malaysia are cleaned. In December, Malaysia's Energy and Environment ministry required Lynas, the only rare earths producer outside of China, to remove the accumulating radioactive wastes to qualify for a renewal. Mahathir said Lynas had intended to send the waste back to Australia but the country does not want to accept it. Rare earths are speciality metals used in everything from ceramics to magnets and consumer electronics. ",24.17999999999938,1
636," By Polina Devitt and Maria Kiselyova MOSCOW, April 5 (Reuters) - Russian grocery chain Magnit has made a $1.78 billion non-binding and indicative proposal to smaller competitor Lenta, topping a rival offer from Russian steel magnate Alexey Mordashov, Lenta said on Friday. The arrival of a second potential bidder for Lenta inflates competition for the third-largest grocery retailer in Russia amid a decline in the shares of many Russian food retailers over the past year. Lenta said on Friday it had received the proposal from Magnit to buy 100 percent of the company for $3.65 per global depository receipt (GDR). Mordashov, whose Severgroup boasts Russian steel producer Severstal at the heart of its empire, had agreed to buy the 42 percent stake, to be followed by a cash offer for all the group's outstanding shares, at $3.60 per GDR. Severgroup declined to comment. Its deal with TPG and the EBRD is binding and expected to be approved by Russia's anti-monopoly regulator by the end of May. Remaining shareholders are free to sell their shares to whoever they want and Mordashov could conceivably resell to Magnit. Lenta said on Friday its independent directors had asked Magnit to confirm it wanted to pursue a deal in light of Mordashov's offer and, if so, to provide details about timing and any conditions. Magnit has not yet provided those details, Lenta said. Magnit confirmed that it was exploring a possible acquisition of 100 percent of Lenta's business. It, however, said that it was Lenta that had not replied to its letter with details on the proposed deal structure and terms on April 1. ""Magnit is looking forward to receiving a response from Lenta and will then consider how it intends to proceed,"" it said in a statement, adding that no assurances can be given that any transaction would take place. Lenta'sLondon-listed GDRs were up 1.3 percent at $3.58 on Friday. Lenta, with a 3.2 percent share of the Russian retail market, could help to boost Magnit's market leadership, while for Mordashov it would add a physical chain to his Utkonos business, the largest online grocery retailer in Russia, an industry source told Reuters. Prosperity Capital Management, which owns about 7 percent in Lenta, a stake in Magnit and rival X5, believes the price offered by Mordashov undervalues Lenta, while a deal with Magnit could achieve substantial cost savings, Alexey Krivoshapko, a portfolio manager at Prosperity, said. He said he hopes Magnit will make a formal bid for Lenta. ",24.17999999999938,1

638," By Karin Strohecker LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Cautious optimism over Sino-U.S. trade talks underpinned global stocks on Friday, benchmark bond yields ground higher and the dollar reached a three-week high against the yen before U.S. job data. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday a trade deal with China might be announced within four weeks, although he warned that it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without an agreement. Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly said progress was being made and called for an early conclusion of talks. MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, edged up and was on track for a second straight week of gains. Better-than expected data out of Germany and receding fears of a disorderly departure from the European Union by the U.K. also helped perk up sentiment. ""The main overnight news, which is positive if not very substantial, is around the U.S.-China trade deal,"" said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""German industrial orders yesterday added to worries in the manufacturing sector, but industrial production today actually surprised to the upside."" German industrial output rose by 0.7 percent in February as mild weather helped a surge in construction activity. But manufacturing production dipped as Germany is suffering from trade friction and Brexit angst after narrowly avoiding recession last year. Leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for 2019 growth on Thursday and warned a long-term upswing had come to an end. The limelight is now shifting to the U.S. payrolls report, which is forecast to rebound to 180,000 in March, following February's distorted 20,000 rise. In focus will be hourly earnings, which climbed to 3.4 percent in February, the fastest pace since April 2009. Hopes for a solid number were boosted by data on jobless claims, which fell to a 49-year low last week, pointing to sustained labour market strength. E-Mini futures pointed to gains for U.S. stocks on Friday, with S&P 500 edging up 0.2 percent. ""Share markets have run hard and fast from their December lows and are vulnerable to a short-term pullback,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital. ""But valuations are okay, global growth is expected to improve into the second half of the year, monetary and fiscal policy has become more supportive of markets and the trade war threat is receding."" On Thursday, the S&P 500 reached its highest level since Oct. 9 and is only 1.75 percent below its record closing high.  BUND YIELDS ABOVE ZERO The cautiously optimistic mood weighed on safe-haven debt, with government bond yields in Europe and the United States rising in early trade. U.S. Treasury yields and German 10-year bond yields, the benchmark for the euro zone, climbed to a two-week high, the latter just above zero. In currencies, the progress on trade was enough to keep the safe-haven yen under pressure and lift the dollar to a three-week high of 111.79. However, against a basket of currencies, the dollar failed to make much progress on the day or on the week. The euro was flat at $1.1225 after dipping overnight. Sterling strengthened back towards $1.31 as a senior European Union source said Donald Tusk was likely to offer Britain a flexible extension of the deadline for its exit from the EU of up to one year. In commodity markets, spot gold dipped to $1,291.61 per ounce but held above a near 10-week low hit overnight. Brent crude futures were off 23 cents at $69.17 after touching $70 a barrel for the first time since November, as expectations of tight global supply outweighed rising U.S. production.

639," By Alistair Smout and Gabriela Baczynska LONDON/BRUSSELS, April 5 (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Party said on Friday that talks with the government on a last-ditch Brexit deal had made no progress, as EU leaders said Prime Minister Theresa May had not convinced them that they should let Britain delay its departure next week. May wrote to Brussels asking European Union leaders to postpone Britain's exit from next Friday until June 30. But they have insisted that she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her divorce deal in the deadlocked parliament. ""We urge the prime minister to come forward with genuine changes to her deal,"" a statement said. Labour Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said his party wanted the talks to go on, and a spokesman for May's office said the government had ""made serious proposals"" in the talks and wanted them to continue over the weekend ""in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides"". May badly needs evidence of a viable divorce strategy to persuade the other 27 EU leaders at a summit next Wednesday to grant a delay, preferably on her preferred departure date. Any extension would require unanimous approval from the other EU countries, all weary of Britain's Brexit indecision, and could come with conditions. ""If we are not able to understand the reason why the UK is asking for an extension, we cannot give a positive answer,"" said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. German Justice Minister Katarina Barley tweeted: ""This playing for time must end."" Deep divisions in May's Conservative Party and government, and in Labour, have led to a marathon of votes in parliament, in which scenarios ranging from abandoning the EU with no transition period to cancelling Brexit have all been defeated. Last Friday, May did the unthinkable by asking Labour to negotiate with her on a deal that might work for both - although some in Labour said she was luring the party into sharing responsibility for her failure.  LETTER TO BRUSSELS Hoping this would satisfy EU leaders, May wrote to EU summit chair Donald Tusk proposing a delay until June 30 at the latest, accepting that Britain might have to hold European Parliament elections on May 23, which she had hoped to avoid. ""The government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May, 2019, and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections, but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible,"" the letter said. So far, there has been little appetite in Brussels for an extension that could create another cliff edge in three months. May asked two weeks ago for a delay until June 30, only to be turned down. Tusk is planning to propose an extension of a year, which could also be shortened if Britain ratifies the withdrawal agreement, senior EU officials said. ""The only reasonable way out would be a long but flexible extension. I would call it a 'flextension',"" one official said. ""It seems to be a good scenario for both sides, as it gives the UK all the necessary flexibility, while avoiding the need to meet every few weeks to further discuss Brexit extensions."" But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said May's letter raised questions, adding: ""We hope for more clarity from London before next Wednesday."" And France, which wants the EU to move on to other business including reforms proposed by President Emmanuel Macron, indicated it was not ready to accept any delay without a clear plan. ""If we are not able to understand the reason why the UK is asking for an extension, we cannot give a positive answer,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters in Bucharest.  SECOND REFERENDUM? Sterling fell against the U.S. dollar immediately after Labour's comments and stood 0.5 percent down on the day. With time running out, it was not clear how Britain would avoid the abrupt ""no-deal"" departure that business leaders in Britain and also neighbouring Ireland say would cause huge disruption. Germany, as one of those with most to lose from a sudden dislocation of trade, has been one of those most tolerant of Britain's turmoil. Justice Minister Barley tweeted that ""there can only be an extension with a clear direction"", but also proposed a potential way out by adding: ""This includes the question of a second referendum."" The idea of asking Britons - who voted by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU three years ago - to confirm or reject any divorce deal has been gaining ground in Britain. Yet May herself and many lawmakers in both main parties are strongly opposed, saying it would betray voters and undermine democracy, especially if it offered an option to stay in the EU. Both main parties made commitments after the referendum to deliver Brexit, but they never settled on a plan for how to leave or what future relationship to seek. May long insisted that her plan - quitting all EU institutions, with a 21-month standstill period to negotiate a bespoke free trade deal - was the only viable one. But it still split her cabinet and infuriated the most eurosceptic of her Conservatives. Labour wants closer ties than May has sought, including a customs union, which she has so far ruled out.

The idea of asking Britons - who voted by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU three years ago - to confirm or reject any divorce deal has been gaining ground in Britain. Yet May herself and many lawmakers in both main parties are strongly opposed, saying it would betray voters and undermine democracy, especially if it offered an option to stay in the EU. Both main parties made commitments after the referendum to deliver Brexit, but they never settled on a plan for how to leave or what future relationship to seek. May long insisted that her plan - quitting all EU institutions, with a 21-month standstill period to negotiate a bespoke free trade deal - was the only viable one. But it still split her cabinet and infuriated the most eurosceptic of her Conservatives. Labour wants closer ties than May has sought, including a customs union, which she has so far ruled out. Many Labour members of parliament insist that any agreement must be put to a second public vote.

643," ZURICH, April 5 (Reuters) - Swiss investors EOS Holding and Primeo Energie are jointly buying French group EDF's 25 percent stake in utility Alpiq Holding for 489 million Swiss francs ($489 million), or 70 francs per share, the companies said on Friday. The move by the two minority shareholders aims to consolidate control of Alpiq in Swiss hands and eventually take the power supplier private, they said in a statement. The stock gained more than 11 percent in early trading and was up 8.1 percent at 70.50 francs by 0815 GMT. ""Alpiq has an opt-out clause so no mandatory offer or minimum price is required but we assume expectations of a price higher than the current one will boost the shares,"" he said in a research note before the market opened. The transaction will be financed through mandatory exchangeable loans from CSA Energy Infrastructure Switzerland, a fund managed by Credit Suisse Energy Infrastructure Partners. EOS until now had 31.4 percent of Alpiq and Primeo Energie had 13.7 percent. The EDF deal will boost the Swiss consortium's combined Alpiq stake to 88 percent. The transaction is set to close in the first half of 2019, subject to approval by German competition authorities. Alpiq accounts for 15-20 percent of Switzerland's power output. It plans to focus on hydropower as Switzerland exits nuclear energy production. ($1 = 0.9995 Swiss francs) ",24.17999999999938,1
644," By Chris Prentice WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - China's lengthy approval process for genetically modified crops remains a sticking point in talks to end the trade war between China and the United States, according to two sources with knowledge of the talks. Beijing has taken years to approve new strains of GM crops, which U.S. companies and farmers have complained stalls trade by restricting the sales of new products from companies such as DowDuPont Inc, Bayer AG, and Syngenta AG. Trump on Thursday said the two sides were getting very close to a deal that could be announced in about four weeks, though there were still differences to be bridged. GM crops and the approval process are still a ""big issue"" in the discussions, said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The issue has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, the bulk of which are genetically modified. If it does not approve new strains, then farmers in the United States cannot plant them because China may reject shipments that include them. Seed companies cannot fully commercialize sales of new strains without those approvals. The two sides had appeared to make some progress on the issue in January, when China approved a handful of GMO crops for import. They were the first in about 18 months. The move did not address the core U.S. concerns over delays to the process. A spokeswoman from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, who is leading the Washington team in the discussions, did not respond immediately to request for confirmation or comment. China'sMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not immediately respond to faxed questions on Friday, which was a public holiday in China. It is unclear what differences on the issue remain. The United States wants China to accelerate its approval process and make it more similar to Washington's. Beijing allows imports of GMO soybeans and corn for use in animal feed, even though it does not permit planting of them. China bought about 60 percent of U.S. soy exports, worth about $12 billion, before the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and could reject shipments of unapproved varieties. Beijing promised to speed up its review of applications during previous trade talks with the United States in 2017. In the past, Beijing has held back approvals of imported GMO products amid concerns about anti-GMO sentiment in China. The trade deal, should it be agreed, is expected to include a six-year time frame for purchases of more than $1 trillion in U.S. goods, including commodity products.

About six of Jet's lessors are likely to apply to India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to de-register up to 15 of the grounded planes, over the next 10 days, said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the situation. While some lessors have already taken a few planes out of India after a mutual agreement with Jet, sources have told Reuters, the latest series of applications to the DGCA would be on a non-consensual basis. Jet did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jet, India's oldest private carrier now controlled by its lenders, has had to ground more than three-quarters of its fleet of 119 planes, many due to non-payment to lessors, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations. Avolon, one of the world's biggest aircraft lessors, on Thursday applied to the DGCA to take two of its planes placed with Jet outside of India, making it the first to pull planes out on a non-consensual basis. About 100 of Jet's 119 mainly Boeing Co planes are leased by companies such as Avolon, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) and Aercap Holdings.

652," By Francesco Guarascio BUCHAREST, April 5 (Reuters) - Italy's economic situation is ""delicate"" and needs to be monitored closely, the European Union economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Friday, as concerns are growing over the threat of recession there and a slowdown in Germany. Moscovici's worries were echoed by France's finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who openly talked of a recession in Italy arriving at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Bucharest which will also discuss the implications for Italy's huge public debt caused by the emigration of skilled workers. Earlier this week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a club of mostly rich nations, forecast a 0.2 percent output fall in Italy this year. Moscovici said the Commission will issue new economic forecasts on May 7. In its latest estimates released in February, the Commission predicted a 0.2 percent growth for Italy this year. He said that the new EU forecasts will acknowledge the current economic slowdown that is most affecting Germany and Italy in the 19-country euro zone. Italy's Finance Minister Giovanni Tria said Italy's economic woes were the result of weaker growth in Germany and in Europe, but declined to give new estimates over the country's growth. In its latest forecasts, the Italian government had predicted a 1 percent expansion this year - a figure that was considered too optimistic by most economists as the Italian eurosceptic government embarked on free-spending plans with little impact on growth. ""We must be very careful about this situation, but we must not be too alarmist,"" Moscovici said. France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire expressed concern over Germany's slowdown and Italy's recession, saying the euro zone's future was at stake if reforms were not agreed on quickly to reduce divergences among its economies. ""There is a concern for the future of the euro zone if we are not able to reduce divergences among the 19 economies of the euro zone,"" Le Maire told reporters, adding that a common budget for the bloc would facilitate convergence and needed to be agreed by June. Ministers will discuss the issue at their meeting on Friday.  BRAIN DRAIN They will also discuss a report from Brussels-based think tank CEPS that raises new concerns about Italy's debt in relation to the growing emigration of skilled workers from the country. The report, seen by Reuters, says Italy was experiencing ""a clear brain drain"" as thousands of high-skilled workers left the country over the last decade without being replaced by immigrants with similar education levels. If this trend continued, it could result in a fall of more than 10 percent in Italy's labour force, the document said. This could worsen the sustainability of the country's large debt, which stands at 130 percent of output, as it would contribute to the ageing of its population and to higher pension costs, the report concluded. Italy's eurosceptic government has increased the country's spending on pensions and opposes immigration. ",24.17999999999938,1
653," By Paul Carrel BERLIN, April 5 (Reuters) - German industrial output rose by 0.7 percent in February as mild weather helped a surge in construction activity but manufacturing production dipped, doing little to boost spiritsin Europe's largest economy after a run of negative news. Germany is suffering from trade friction and Brexit angst after narrowly avoiding recession last year. Leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for 2019 growth on Thursday and warned a long-term upswing had come to an end. ""The industrial sector is expected to remain subdued given the weak development in orders and the gloomier business climate,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement. ""The construction sector remains in a boom. The relatively mild weather contributed to the good result in February."" Industrial orders in Germany fell by the biggest margin in more than two years in February, slumping 4.2 percent, data showed on Thursday. The overall gain in industrial output was boosted by a 6.8 percent surge in construction. Manufacturing output declined by 0.2 percent in February. In the first two months of the year, auto industry output fell 1.0 percent from the prior two months. Commerzbank economist Ralph Solveen said the relatively warm weather would help the economy grow in the first quarter thanks to stronger construction investment, adding: ""Without this effect, hardly any growth is to be expected in the first half."" On Thursday, Germany's leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for 2019 growth by more than half and warned that the economy could slow much more if Britain quits the European Union without an agreement. Germany is in its 10th year of economic expansion, but narrowly skirted a recession at the end of last year and posted its weakest growth in five years in 2018. Its export-orientated economy is being slowed by the trade and Brexit headwinds. ""German industry remains an international reason for concern,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. ""Brexit woes and the global slowdown have a stranglehold over German industry."" Officials are hopeful that once global trade disputes and Brexit are resolved, growth can pick up next year. Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly said she will ""fight until the last hour"" for an orderly Brexit. Germany's slower-than-previously-expected growth means Finance Minister Olaf Scholz's room for manoeuvre on fiscal matters is getting tighter as tax revenues are likely to come in lower than expected this year. Last month, the cabinet passed a draft budget for 2020 that calls for a 1.7 percent spending increase and relies on ministries to cut costs to avoid incurring new debt in light of the slowdown.

655," By Hadeel Al Sayegh, Saeed Azhar and Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, April 4 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is considering a secondary listing for its subsidiary ADNOC Distribution overseas, three sources told Reuters. In 2017 ADNOC listed 10 percent of ADNOC Distribution, the largest operator of petrol stations and convenience stores in the United Arab Emirates, on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. ADNOC Distribution was seeking a minimum free float of 15 percent to improve its chances of joining the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and attract more international investors, a source told Reuters at the time. One of the sources said ADNOC was considering listing ADNOC Distribution on New York's Nasdaq exchange, while a second source added that a London listing had also been discussed. Another source said that Abu Dhabi was also one of the options being discussed. The company started discussing an international listing ""a while ago,"" said one of the sources, adding that there was no imminent plan to proceed with the transaction. The sources declined to be named due to commercial sensitivities. A spokesman for ADNOC said: ""As evidenced from ADNOC Distribution's solid financial results in 2018, the company continues to deliver on its business objectives and is making good progress in the implementation of its growth plans. This remains our focus at present. ADNOC does not comment on market speculation."" The sale of more shares in ADNOC Distribution, should it materialise, would be the latest sign that the Gulf's giant oil companies are increasingly turning to international capital markets to fund expansion. Before oil prices crashed in 2014, state energy firms in the Gulf largely financed themselves with money from their governments. But low oil and gas prices has put government finances under pressure. Saudi state oil giant Aramco is currently meeting global investors ahead of an inaugural international bond, after postponing its planned initial public offering last year until 2021. For ADNOC Distribution, an obstacle to listing now is that its shares have mostly been trading below their IPO price, making it unattractive for the company to sell and for foreigners to buy if they think they can purchase the stock cheaper on the public market at a later date. On Thursday the shares traded at the IPO price of 2.5 dirhams before the company announced that shareholders approved a dividend increase. Before the initial listing in 2017, ADNOC said it might sell as much as 20 percent in the fuel distribution unit. ",24.17999999999938,1

662," JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Reuters) - The South African rand firmed on Friday and was on course for gains of around 3 percent this week against the dollar, as appetite for local assets was lifted by Moody's delaying a credit rating review and optimism over U.S.-China trade talks. At 0705 GMT, the rand had gained 0.2 percent to 14.0900 against the dollar compared to its previous close. Signs of progress in the trade talks between the world's two largest economies has bolstered demand for emerging market currencies, including the rand, as it bodes well for global economic growth. Moody's rating is particularly sensitive for South Africa because it is the only one of the big three rating agencies that still rates the country's debt in the coveted investment grade bracket. South African stocks opened stronger, with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's Top-40 index up 0.5 percent at 51,684 points. In fixed income, the benchmark 2026 government bond gained, with the yield falling by 1.5 basis points to 8.520 percent. ",24.17999999999938,1
663," TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Japanese retail group Aeon slashed its annual profit estimate by 12 percent, citing bad weather and weak consumer sentiment. The company warned that it expected to report a profit of 212 billion yen ($1.90 billion) for the year that ended in February, down from its previous forecast of 240 billion. The market's consensus forecast was for 226 billion yen, according to Refinitiv data.

664," BRUSSELS, April 5 (Reuters) - The chairman of European Union leaders Donald Tusk is likely to offer Britain a flexible extension of the date of the country's exit from the EU of up to one year, with the possibility of leaving sooner, a senior EU official said. The official said the option could be presented to British Prime Minister Theresa May at the EU summit on Brexit on April 10th in Brussels. If May accepted, Britain would have to hold elections to the European parliament in May, the official said. ""The only reasonable way out would be a long but flexible extension. I would call it a 'flextension',"" the official said. ""And even if this were not possible, then the UK would still have enough time to rethink its Brexit strategy. A short extension if possible, and a long one if necessary. It seems to be a good scenario for both sides, as it gives the UK all the necessary flexibility, while avoiding the need to meet every few weeks to further discuss Brexit extensions,"" he said. Britain's exit from the EU, nearly three years since the country voted to leave the bloc, is now in doubt because the British parliament cannot decide what exit terms it wants, just a week before the current Brexit date of April 12. May offered to quit to get her deal passed but it was defeated for a third time last Friday, the day Britain was originally due to leave the EU. She is now in talks with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to find a way out of the deadlock, but it is not clear if they can find a solution in the next few days. A request for an extension, if May makes one, would have to be backed by sound arguments why the EU should grant it, officials said. Britain'sBBC reported that May would make such a request on Friday. ""If we are not able to understand the reason why the UK is asking for an extension, we cannot give a positive answer,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters in Bucharest, when asked about the possible 12-month extension.

667," April 5 (Reuters) - Ladbrokes owner GVC Holdings Plc on Friday posted an 8 percent growth in quarterly net gaming revenue, as strong online performance in sports and gaming bets offset retail weakness in Britain. The company reported flat like-for-like retail revenue in the UK for the first quarter ended March 31, but online net gaming revenue rose 17 percent. The company, Britain's largest high street bookmaker, has expanded through partnerships and of late has been focusing on the sports-betting and gaming opportunities in the United States. The company said it was confident of achieving its target of double-digit online growth in gaming revenue in 2019. However, back home in Britain, restrictions on Fixed Odd Betting Terminals was expected to result in the closure of up to a 1,000 shops and impact GVC's 2019 core profit by about 135 million pounds ($176.6 million). Fixed odds betting terminals are electronic machines in betting shops, which contain a variety of games, including roulette. The new regulations were implemented in April and maximum betting was limited to 2 pounds ($2.62) from a 100 pounds in an effort to keep a check on problem gambling. ""We expect it to be several weeks before we can start to assess the impact,"" Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Alexander said in a statement. However, the company, which offers sports betting, casino, poker and bingo and has licences in over 20 countries, was confident of meeting the expectations for its overall full-year core and operating profit.

668," By Vuyani Ndaba JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Reuters) - Yield-hungry investors will trade cautiously in risky emerging market currencies this year against the dollar despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent dovish stance, a Reuters poll found, though there is still interest. ""The outlook for high yielding currencies remains constructive due to the increasingly accommodative messaging from the both the ECB and Fed,"" said Mike Keenan, a strategist at Absa Capital. ""That said, a deep global slowdown poses a significant risk to the longevity of the carry trade because under such a scenario, market volatility is likely to spike and investors will probably become more risk averse,"" Keenan added. ""Carry trades"" is a strategy used by investors to borrow in currencies where interest rates are low and thereafter invest in countries where yields are high, such as in emerging markets. A similar survey in September expected many emerging market currencies to bounce back at least partially against the dollar this year as weakening growth momentum took the shine off the greenback. However, Turkey's lira, will play no part in any lure for higher yield returns as it is expected to continue falling - over 11 percent to 6.25 per greenback in a year - amid rising tensions with the United States and potential uncertainty after local elections. Emerging market currencies have not yet shot the 2019 lights out compared to recent bouts when carry trades were in full favour among investors as the Fed pumped in massive quantitative easing liquidity. ""We remain optimistic on emerging market foreign exchange and debt for 2019 and 2020,"" wrote macroeconomic research house Continuum Economics in a note. ""A reversal of dollar strength and the Fed's change in monetary policy outlook are key to our view,"" the note added. The rand is currently enjoying the best performer spot this week among emerging market currencies track by Reuters with over 2 percent gains pushing it to 14.18 per dollar after Moody's said late on Friday it would not publish a review of the country's sovereign debt rating as indicatively scheduled. Keenan said due to lingering idiosyncratic risks, the rand underperformed fellow high-yielding currencies during the first quarter. However, following this week's swift recovery, he said it was now back to fair value relative to its peers. Though Continuum Economics warned Brazilian rates had already priced in much of the positive impact of the pension reform and with the central bank unlikely to hike this year, it does not expect yields to become much more attractive.

Welcome to the RPM International Inc. investor call for our fiscal 2019 third quarter ended February 28, 2019. On the call with me today are Rusty Gordon, RPM's vice president and chief financial officer; and Kristine Schulze, our senior director of financial reporting. I'll begin by providing broad perspective on our third-quarter results, after which Kristine will run through our numbers in more detail. She'll be followed by Rusty Gordon, who will provide a progress update on our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan and share our outlook for the balance of the year.

When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and RPM International wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of March 1, 2019 During the fiscal 2019 third quarter, we generated consolidated sales of $1.140 billion, which was an increase of 3.4% over the same period in fiscal 2018. This was a solid performance during what is our seasonally slowest quarter due to winter weather conditions across many of the countries and markets we serve. Organic growth was 4.3%. Acquisitions contributed 2.1%, while foreign exchange was a significant headwind, mostly in our industrial segment, which reduced sales by 3%. From a geographic perspective, our companies in North America, and particularly in the United States, performed well. While international operations, particularly those in Europe and Latin America, were challenged, reflecting challenging macroeconomic conditions in those regions. Price increases helped to offset higher costs for freight, labor, energy and raw materials, which were higher for the seventh straight quarter. Current-quarter EBIT finished behind last year's third quarter, when EBIT was up an extraordinary 53% over the prior year due to a number of nonrecurring items. However, we see this quarter's adjusted EBIT of $46.9 million, which is our second best third quarter ever, as still strong as it was well ahead of our third quarter average EBIT of $37.8 million during the three-year period from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017. Our current-quarter gross profit margin was 60 basis points behind the 2018 third-quarter results, which is a less deterioration than prior quarters. While our MAP to Growth savings initiatives are taking root, the fiscal 2019 third-quarter gross profit margin reflects a combination of moderating inflation, MAP to Growth improvements and an unfavorable product mix. And looking at our SG&A on a comparative basis, last year's third quarter SG&A was favorably impacted by an incentive reversal of $3.4 million, something we mentioned on our January conference call, while this year's SG&A includes additional expense from recent acquisitions and continuing higher advertising and distribution costs. Implementation of our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan has moved rapidly, and we are making significant progress toward our goals. While we are starting to experience some benefits from our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan, due to FIFO accounting, many of the MAP to Growth initiatives we have executed in manufacturing and procurement areas will start to show up in our income statement in the coming quarters. I'll now turn the call over to Kristine Schulze, who will walk you through our results in more detail. Kristine Schulze -- Senior Director of Financial Reporting Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. During our fiscal 2019 third quarter, we reported restructuring charges of $8.7 million and other related expenses of $11.9 million. As I walk through our results of operations for the quarter, my comments will be on an as-adjusted basis, which excludes these charges. As Frank mentioned, our consolidated net sales were $1.14 billion, which was an increase of 3.4% over the $1.1 billion reported during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Organic growth was 4.3% or $47.5 million. Acquisitions contributed 2.1% or $23.3 million, while foreign exchange was a significant headwind that reduced sales by 3% or $32.9 million. Impacting earnings were higher costs for raw materials, freight, labor and energy, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. While some raw materials are moderating, others continue to increase, including packaging. We have been successfully implementing selling price increases to close the gap on our margins and are starting to see the benefits. Our margin recovery tends to lag because we utilize the FIFO method of accounting for our inventory, so the impact of easing raw material costs should be more fully realized in the coming quarters. Industrial segment net sales increased by $11.7 million or 2.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the same period last year. This increase was comprised of organic volume growth of $27.2 million or 4.8% and acquisitions of $7.6 million or 1.3%. This sales growth was offset by a 4% headwind from translational foreign exchange. Top-line growth in the segment was led by our North American businesses providing corrosion control coating, fiberglass grating, commercial sealants and concrete admixture and repair products. Businesses in this segment also continued to benefit from the energy market recovery. This was partially offset by foreign exchange and international weakness in the segment, which has our greatest international exposure. Adjusted EBIT was $19.5 million during this year's third quarter. In our consumer segment, fiscal 2019 third-quarter net sales increased by $21.6 million or 6% versus the same period last year. This quarter sales were comprised of organic growth of $19.3 million or 5.3% and acquisitions of $9.9 million or 2.7%. Partially offsetting sales growth was a 2% headwind from translational foreign exchange. Raw material costs were still a headwind but began to moderate. Again, because we use the FIFO method of accounting for our inventory, our margin recovery can still lag our peers on LIFO. During the quarter, we gained market share from our competitors in the small project paints category, continuing the favorable trend that started last spring at major retailers. Earnings would have been ahead of the prior year except for higher distribution and advertising expenses. Adjusted EBIT was $27.1 million during this year's third quarter. Specialty segment net sales increased $4.6 million or 2.7% in the fiscal 2019 third quarter versus last year's third quarter. Organic growth was relatively flat with an increase of $1 million or 0.6%. Sales growth was primarily the result of our acquisition of insulated concrete forms manufacturer, Nudura, which contributed $5.8 million or 3.4% to sales. Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of $2.2 million or 1.3%. Contributing to organic growth were our businesses providing fluorescent colorants, marine coatings and exterior cladding systems. Sales at our restoration equipment business were behind the prior year, which was extraordinarily strong due to a large sales backlog that resulted from Hurricane Harvey. Substantially all of the segment's third-quarter EBIT decline versus the prior year was due to start-up investments for our NewBrick exterior cladding product and Nudura, which has pronounced seasonality in the third quarter. Adjusted EBIT for the fiscal '19 third quarter was $18.8 million. Also during the quarter, we issued $350 million in bonds and used the proceeds to pay down a portion of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, as of today, we've effectively repurchased approximately $400 million of our common stock, half of which was accomplished through the redemption of our convertible bonds last November. The share repurchases support our MAP to Growth objective to return $1.5 billion in capital to our stockholders by May 31, 2021, through a combination o f dividends and share repurchases. I'll now turn the call over to Rusty, who will provide an update on our MAP to Growth initiative and also share our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Rusty Gordon -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Kristine. In regard to our MAP to Growth operating improvement initiative, we have moved with great urgency and are making excellent progress toward the objectives we laid out at our Investor Day last November. Since the initiation of the plan, we have closed or are in the process of closing 12 manufacturing plants and have announced the reduction of 502 positions. We have also taken great strides to upgrade our manufacturing processes, optimize assets, reduce inventory and improve our supply chain. If you take a look at the second slide in the deck on our website, you'll see the progress we have made in procurement. Our center-led purchasing team has changed our approach since they are authorized to speak for all RPM volume. As a result, we have narrowed our supplier base and changed our strategy to enable better pricing and terms than our historic norms. Another example is manufacturing, which you'll find on Slide No. 3, where we are implementing a culture of continuous improvement. We continue to reduce our plant footprint and optimize existing assets. We are working individually on a plant-by-plant basis to reduce yield losses and improve equipment uptimes. On the SG&A front, which you'll see on Slide No. 4, we have delayered top management. As a result, we have simplified our organizational structure and better aligned with our strategy to create global brands. The resulting cost savings from our first wave, which you'll see on Slide No. 5, will conclude at the end of this fiscal year and are projected to meet our original target. As you may have noticed on the slide, manufacturing appears to be running slightly behind the wave one target, while SG&A is running a bit ahead. This is simply due to a reallocation of distribution expenses between these two expense categories. Based on the success of the MAP to Growth so far, we expect to meet the long-term margin improvement objectives that we laid out at our November 28, 2018 Investor Day. I'll now turn to our fiscal 2019 outlook. Our outlook for this year's fourth quarter, which is seasonally our strongest, is positive. In the quarter, we expect to generate low single-digit consolidated sales growth and double-digit EBIT growth, resulting from recently implemented price increases taking hold, our MAP to Growth savings being realized and moderating raw material cost. Industrial segment sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be flat to slightly down as the segment will be impacted by tough comparisons to last fiscal year, as well as its exposure to weakening international markets and unfavorable foreign exchange. This should be offset by savings from our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan and moderating raw material expenses. For our consumer segment, we anticipate high single-digit sales growth due to easier comparisons to last fiscal year, as well as margin recovery beginning to take hold. In the specialty segment, which comprises about 15% of consolidated sales, the sales growth should be modest. We expect a normal effective tax rate of 26% to 27% in the fourth quarter, which will be higher than last year's rate due to adjustments related to tax reform. Based on our expectations for solid top-line sales growth and double-digit EBIT growth, our fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter adjusted earnings guidance is a range of $1.12 to $1.16 per diluted share, which includes accretion of $0.03 to $0.04 a share as a result of share repurchases completed this year versus the adjusted $1.05 during last year's fourth quarter. Now I'll turn the call back over to Frank. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Rusty. Before we open up the call to questions, I want to take a moment to thank our associates around the world for their dedication to continuing to grow the RPM businesses while also implementing our MAP to Growth operating improvement plan. One more note on our MAP to Growth program. Many of you met our colleague and friend, Steve Knoop, at our Investor Day in Baltimore on November 28 of last year. In addition to heading up our specialty products group, Steve had made significant contributions to the planning for our MAP to Growth initiative. Unfortunately, Steve has been on medical leave since January. In his absence, I have taken on Steve's duties related to our MAP to Growth initiative, and as you can see, based on his strong effort, we're off to a great start. Lastly, I'd like to mention that we recently concluded our annual growth and strategy conference, which we hold each year in March. This year, I challenged our company leaders to think big about growth and innovation. They delivered ambitious plans to accelerate growth from innovative new products and service offerings. While we were together, I reminded them that, although the marketplace values growth over efficiency, we will be able to deliver both through our MAP to Growth program. We will continue to be world class when it comes to sales, marketing and top-line growth, and we are becoming world class in our operations. This one-two punch will make us very difficult to beat in the markets we serve. We're now pleased to take your questions. Operator [Operator instructions] And our first question on the line comes from Mr. John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, John. Rusty Gordon -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Good morning. John McNulty -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analsyt Thanks, Frank. Good morning. So I guess a couple of things. It sounds like on the procurement front, you're starting to make some headline. Maybe we haven't seen it because of FIFO. But I guess when you're looking out over, say, the next 12 months, I assume there's some improvement on the working capital side of this. So can you give us some color as to how we should be thinking about the potential for improvement in terms of working capital as we're kind of looking out over the next 12 months or so? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. And we did not provide slides on working capital improvement. We will in the future. It's our anticipation that most of the working capital improvement will occur in wave two and wave three because the most significant benefits that are sustainable will come out of both the asset optimization, as well as the operating improvement initiatives that we are taking through our businesses plant by plant, starting with our largest operations. And so if you look at our balance sheet, you'll see a year-over-year decline in inventory, which is a good step in the right direction. Part of that is a result of a write-off in our consumer segment in last year's fourth quarter, and part of that are the beginning of the benefits of these operating improvement initiatives on lower investment in working capital. But the most meaningful benefits will come in waves two and three as they follow the operating improvement activities we're undertaking. John McNulty -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analsyt Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess a question. Rusty had made a comment, I guess, regarding, on the manufacturing front, things were maybe a little bit lighter, or I wouldn't say behind schedule but were maybe coming a little slow, and SG&A was a little bit ahead. What was the driver for that again? Because I didn't quite catch what you were getting at. Rusty Gordon -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer There's two issues there. The first is I think, we thought and I communicated that the timing of a plant closure announcement and the actual cessation of operations and our beginning to benefit from those savings was 90 days. And that was, in hindsight, incorrect and a little bit naive. I think the timing from announcement to closure is more like five months. And so while we have announced these plant closures and we're in the process of doing it, it's taking a little bit longer in some instances than we thought. The second and more meaningful area is when we laid out the MAP to Growth initiative in November, we assumed, in the manufacturing pieces, all facility closures. And while we have announced the closure of 12 manufacturing facilities, we've also closed, and this was part of the manufacturing piece on our Investor Day, November 28, more than a dozen warehouses and other offices. And all of those are properly reflected in SG&A, not in cost of sales. And so that's just a reallocation between what we originally communicated during our Investor Day in manufacturing that is actually an improvement in SG&A. John McNulty -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analsyt Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one last question on a different angle. So can you speak to kind of what you're seeing with regard to the M&A environment and pipeline? It looked like it helped you, obviously, this quarter with some sales lift. How does the environment look going forward? And also, I guess, maybe can you speak to your appetite for M&A just given that you've got so much going on with the restructuring? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. That's a great question. The pipeline for the typical small to medium-sized acquisitions that we're looking at is pretty good. We are focused on executing the MAP improvement program -- the MAP to Growth program. There's a lot of acquisition activity in our space. And as we look at it, we are dedicated to, first, executing on the operating improvement initiative and, in any event, maintaining an investment-grade rating as it relates to acquisition activity combined with some of our return of capital commitments. John McNulty -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analsyt Got it. Great. Thanks very much for the call. Operator Our next question on the line comes from Mr. Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Frank. Frank Mitsch -- Fermium Research -- Analyst Good morning, folks. Hey, obviously wishing a full and speedy recovery. Frank, can you talk about what you're seeing on the ground in Europe in terms of demand? What are your expectations in terms of volume growth there? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Europe's weak, and Europe's been relatively flat for most of the year. In some areas, we're seeing year-over-year declines. I think when you look at our total growth, we had, regionally, 5%-plus growth in North America and minus 3% in Europe. A big part of that minus 3% was foreign exchange. So excluding foreign exchange, real modest to flat growth in Europe. And there's not a lot that suggests that that's going to get better, and we're not planning for it to get better as we think about our new fiscal year. Frank Mitsch -- Fermium Research -- Analyst And as you look at the MAP to Growth program, how much of that is tied or geared toward Europe? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There are meaningful opportunities for us in Europe, and we certainly are focused there in terms of some opportunities to consolidate various aspects of G&A, manufacturing and distribution. And I think that's as far as we would go in terms of detail. Frank Mitsch -- Fermium Research -- Analyst All right. I was trying to get how many plants out of the 12. But last question. You folks mentioned a couple of times that FIFO is restraining the savings that you're seeing in MAP to Growth and also restraining the ability to recoup the decline in raw materials or at least the moderation in raw materials. With that said, what sort of a tailwind are you entering fiscal fourth quarter just based on FIFO accounting on those opportunities? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I can't answer that specifically, and it's not really restraining. All it is, is an accounting difference versus some of our largest industry peers who report on LIFO. And so to the extent that we are seeing benefits of operating improvements or price increases or moderating raw material costs capitalized in inventory, it shows up in our results typically 90 days later than it would in somebody who's reporting on LIFO. But I think as you can see, and we hope in the future to be able to add some detail to the MAP to Growth slides that Rusty referred to this morning, we believe there's $34 million of improved raw material cost as a result of our ability to consolidate raw material purchases and really be a more strategic partner to a smaller and larger, in terms of size and impact, supplier base. And so those are dollars that we're confident we're achieving on the ground, and they will begin to show up in our financial results in Q4 and Q1. Frank Mitsch -- Fermium Research -- Analyst That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question on the line comes from Ms. Rosemarie Morbelli from G. Research. Please go ahead. Rosemarie Morbelli -- G. Research -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. We are hearing a lot about international being weak, and you mentioned Europe and Latin America. So looking at Europe, you don't see any improvement. But what I was wondering is if you could talk about whether the trend during the quarter. Are you actually seeing it declining some more, worsening? And if you could touch on the different markets you serve and the trends in those. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. I think the as-reported results have actually deteriorated a little bit as a result of flat organic growth in those markets and then the negative impact of FX, which certainly hit us in the third quarter. And it's our expectation that we'll see more of the same in Q4. It just seems to be kind of a stagnant environment, and there continues to be, among our customer base and even ourselves as we think about opportunities for improvement in Europe, some decision-making stalling around Brexit and where assets should be and what businesses, including our customers, should be doing in relationship to their thinking about the EU and the U.K. and Europe. So we don't see it getting better. Rosemarie Morbelli -- G. Research -- Analyst And any particular market that is especially weak versus, if we exclude FX, a flat demand? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No. As you'll recall in our January quarter, the weakness that we have is regional, not necessarily a product or markets. And so we've got a pretty good quarter in the third quarter, and it's continuing in Q4 across all of our businesses in North America and particularly the U.S. And we are pretty flat to weak across all our businesses and product categories in Europe, so I wouldn't point to any particular industry. It's more of a regional issue. Rosemarie Morbelli -- G. Research -- Analyst OK. And then moving on to the consumer, you're continuing to gain share. Can you talk about the share gain you are seeing, if any, when you exclude the benefit from the switch at Home Depot, for example, out of Sherwin-Williams? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. That's certainly one, and that's going quite well. And we've also had some small project paint pickup in the hardware store paint channels, and we've also had some recovery in some lost share at Lowe's as a result of some of the strategic alignments and changes last year in the spring. And as folks know, we lost some business there, and we are recovering some of what was lost business. And so our consumer segment team is doing a great job. And they're picking up market share in small project paint because that's where they live. Whether it's new colors, new products, new textures, in some cases, new packaging and new delivery, they're doing a really nice job. To that, as we enter the spring, we're seeing some solid POS, so point of sale, takeaway by consumers. It's better than it's been for the last four or five quarters, and hopefully, that will continue. But it seems like we're finally seeing some good consumer takeaway in those categories after what's been a relatively weak four or five quarters of POS. Rosemarie Morbelli -- G. Research -- Analyst And lastly, if I may, following up on the M&A pipeline. Do you have any appetite for a large acquisition and one that you could fit into one of your industrial product lines? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So our acquisition pipeline is pretty good as it always has been, particularly in the small to medium-sized acquisitions. And as it relates to all the acquisition activity in our industry, whatever we would do, we would seek to maintain an investment-grade rating between our acquisition activity and our commitments on returning capital to shareholders. Operator Our next question on the line comes from Mr. Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Steve Haynes -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Good morning. This is actually Steve on for Vincent. So a quick question on SG&A. Last quarter, you guys broke out a reconciliation for SG&A to adjusted SG&A. And I was curious if you could maybe bucket this quarter where some of your MAP to Growth initiatives stood in COGS versus SG&A? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Just broadly, first of all, third quarter, and we highlighted that given its seasonality, is all over the place. So this quarter was down meaningfully from last year. There were a lot of onetime items. We are up 25% at the EBIT line from our FY '17 third quarter EBIT. And so that gives you a sense of why we think it's a pretty good third quarter and also the volatility given the seasonal low. In SG&A, we mentioned in January about the long-term incentive reversal last year in the third quarter. We had a number of incentive comp reversals last year in Q3 as it became apparent that we were not going to hit any of our near term or long-term targets. On a year-over-year basis, looking at comp this year versus comp last year, there is a hit to earnings in the high single digits in terms of millions of dollars. We have communicated throughout the year that we were going to have a higher level of advertising in our consumer segment as we picked up market share and picked up new categories, and that has been true and it was true again in the third quarter and it will be true in the fourth quarter. And then the last comment I would make is that all of these, and this is unique to RPM. We're seeing higher freight and distribution expense, unique to RPM, the freight out and distribution expenses reflected in SG&A versus most of our competitors that reflect that in cost of goods sold. And we're seeing higher labor costs pretty much everywhere, whether it's in our core staff or in our plants. And so those are what reflect the big swings in SG&A in what is a seasonally low quarter anyways. Steve Haynes -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst OK. So just in regard to the restructuring charges specifically, though. Is it possible you could break that out between COGS and SG&A or -- Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I don't know that we've done that. We highlighted the restructuring charges. The two categories are all restructuring-related. The first category, which Rusty reminded me, is about $9 million. Rusty Gordon -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, for the SPC -- Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And so that's really -- Rusty Gordon -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer That's a charge on the income statement. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. What you can formally quantify or quantify is, for accounting purposes, restructuring. And then the other charges were principally professional fees. We have significant fees with the consultants, AlixPartners is the largest one but other consultants in IT areas. They're a part of our implementation. Beyond that, we haven't really quantified it between cost of goods sold and SG&A. Kristine Schulze -- Senior Director of Financial Reporting And that's true. I would refer you to our website to take a look at our non-GAAP slides, where we have further detail on each item. Operator Our next question on the line comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi -- Baird -- Analyst Good morning, guys. Good morning, Frank. Good morning, everyone. I guess first off, on the 4.3% organic growth, can you sort of break that out between volume and maybe price mix? And then related to that, Frank, I mean, a lot of companies have called out unfavorable weather, particularly in January and February. Just curious as to what sort of impact you saw and then, maybe related to that, what you're seeing so far in March. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Across RPM, our net organic growth on a consolidated basis, it's about 2% price, and the weather was a negative impact. Our industrial segment, in particular, our Tremco Roofing business, those are challenged businesses when you have a very wet period of time. I think one of our peer competitors highlighted the rain and snow, and this is supposedly one of the wettest years since 1983. Weather happens every year and weather happens every quarter, and we don't like hearing about it from our operations any more than our investors like hearing about it from us. But it was certainly an impact in the year. We're off to a good start in the spring. And as long as we don't end up with a very wet end of May and June like we had last year, I think we'll have a pretty solid performance in our industrial businesses that are weather-related and also in consumer. As I said, the early signs for spring POS are good, but that is most definitely impacted by weather. Ghansham Panjabi -- Baird -- Analyst Terrific. That's very helpful. And then just in terms of guidance specific to the fourth quarter low single-digit top-line growth and double-digit EBIT growth, can you just give us a bit more detail on how that breaks out across the various buckets, pricing, cost savings, low raw material cost, whatever way you want us to sort of think about that from a stack rank perspective? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I would expect us to see the first quarter in about six or so, seven quarters where gross margins are flat to slightly up. And that's a combination of mix of business. It's a combination of our company's price efforts and what we see as moderating raw material costs. In our third quarter, raw material costs, again, sequentially were improved by a couple percentage points, but we were still, year over year, up by high single-digit rates. And so as we get into the fourth quarter, we'll start to annualize the significant increases that started before last year in the fourth quarter but really were pronounced in the fourth quarter. And you will also see the benefits, as I said, of the MAP to Growth initiatives that have already been completed but really show up in our cost of sales and our gross margin as we sell the inventory in which overhead and raw material costs are capitalized. Ghansham Panjabi -- Baird -- Analyst And then just one final one on fiscal-year '20, if I could. I mean, understanding it's early, but at this point, what's reasonable for us as we kind of tighten up our models too soon for core volume growth or core sales growth for fiscal-year '20? And then just as a clarification on Slide 5, toward the plant summary in your slide deck, you called out an annualized run rate to benefit 2020 of $104 million. Is that fiscal-year '20 or calendar-year '20? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So the annualized run rate is fiscal-year '20. And again, I think the factors that have impeded our ability to get the head start we had hoped for in fiscal '19 are also impacting all industry and our peers. It's inflation not only in raw materials but freight, labor and a lot of other factors. Slowing growth in Europe is going to be an issue for everybody, and so those issues will impact us. And so we've got to make sure that we continue to push our operating improvement initiatives so that we can overcome as much of these headwinds as possible. I think if we're looking at 13% to 15% EBIT growth in our fourth quarter, we would expect to see something in the neighborhood of 20% or maybe slightly higher EBIT growth in Q1 and that you should see that hopefully accelerate. But we don't finalize our 2020 planning until the end of May. And we will provide more specific details, both on our expectations for 2020 and the impact of MAP to Growth, when we release fourth-quarter earnings on July 22. Operator Our next question on line comes from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead. Jason Rodgers -- Great Lakes Review-- Analyst Good morning. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Jason Rodgers -- Great Lakes Review-- Analyst I do want to ask about the ERP consolidations that has begun and maybe just discuss the timeline there? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer All right, sure. We would expect to have the lion's share of our ERP implementations done by December 31, 2020. And what is left to be done at that point would be small, kind of, far away international sites. We're about 50% done across RPM. Some of that is because we're already pretty heavily consolidated into SAP, for instance, in our construction products group and our Specialty Products Group, under Steve Knoop's leadership had started ERP implementation consolidation into Microsoft D 365 probably 15 months ago. So we're two-thirds of the way through there. And it's something that our IT people are pretty adept at because, in the last five or six years, we have regularly completely integrated acquisitions into the base system of whoever the core RPM acquiring company was. Jason Rodgers -- Great Lakes Review-- Analyst All right. And maybe just a few for Rusty. Do you have the number of shares bought in the quarter? And the total spend? And the share count that you're assuming for the fourth quarter? Rusty Gordon -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sure, yes. So far this year, we have, through February 28, bought back about 2.8 million shares. And in addition to that, we retired a convertible for mostly cash. So that's up about 3.3 million shares off the table. So, so far, 6 million shares were down between repurchase and the convertible redemption. So you should see in our fourth quarter that magnitude of a decline in our diluted share count, and that's offset by stock vesting and awards, which will be a small offset -- Jason Rodgers -- Great Lakes Review-- Analyst And then just to follow up earlier on the SG&A question. Do you have an adjusted SG&A number for the quarter? Because that was in the slide last quarter, but I didn't see it this quarter. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. No, we did not. And again, it's in relationship to all of the moving parts in the quarter and given the seasonality of the third quarter. The other thing that negatively impacted us in the third quarter, which Rusty commented on but we can quantify a little bit better. In our specialty products group, the Nudura business, which is off to a great start. We're really excited about it. It's really the wave of the future for construction. Seasonally, they lose money in our third quarter. And so they are accentuating our quarterly seasonality. I think their revenues, we disclosed at about $50 million when we acquired them. And then the other element in specialty that particularly impacted our third quarter is we're accelerating our investment drive at brick, and that's an exciting new product. Year to date, we have about $2 million in sales and $5 million of operating losses. Almost half of that is in the third quarter. We have plans to automate most of their production, and that's going to be a blockbuster product line. At some point, that's our plan. But if it does not turn out that way, those are operating losses that can easily be eliminated. Operator Our next question on line comes from Mr. Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Kevin McCarthy -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst Good morning, all. With regards to your Slide No. 5, how much of the $104 million in run rate savings would you expect to actually hit the income statement in fiscal '19? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I think we'll have a better sense of that, Kevin, in July, and we'll communicate that to folks. And I think, it really depends on also how much of that run rate is experienced in our fourth quarter. And so that's an annualized run rate that we expect to be at as of May 31. There'll be portions of that that will benefit our fourth quarter. And then, of course, there'll be portions of wave two that should benefit the second half of the 2020 fiscal year. And we'll have a much better sense of how to break that out, both, by category and by July, we hope, by segment so you can understand that. Kevin McCarthy -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst OK. Appreciate that. Second, I was wondering if you can elaborate on your raw material cost trends? As we look at some of the building blocks that tend to go into your industry. Propylene is coming down hard over the last six months. Some of the upstream silicon products seem to have as well. So what are you seeing in your basket in terms of sequential trends? And do you have an early read on how fiscal 2020 could trend in that regard? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. The macro picture is pretty volatile. Oil has come down a lot and propylene follow that. Those core building blocks don't translate into raw material savings or the products we buy immediately. Interestingly, since January 1, oil prices are up 30%. And so as I mentioned earlier, sequentially, the third quarter was the second quarter in row where we've seen sequential improvement in our base top raw materials. But we're still, year over year, up high single digits. And so we're gaining on margin through price mix and what feels like moderation across our core largest raw materials. The biggest impact to that in our fourth quarter, like we believe, will be the strategic change in approach on procurement as we have consolidated purchasing. I think it took a while for us to hit our stride. But we've had a number of categories where we might have been buying from a different vendors, and we consolidated down to two or three. And it's moved significant volume to strategic partners, and it's moving volume away from either smaller or less-inclinedto-cooperate suppliers. And so it's been an interesting process for us that's having good results. Kevin McCarthy -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst OK. And then lastly, if I may, in your prior quarter, you had discussed some mark-to-market impact related to the captive insurance business. Just wondering if you saw any impact from that in the fiscal third quarter or would expect any in the fourth quarter. Rusty Gordon -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Kevin, on investment income line, you'll see we were down about $700,000 from last year. So the performance was not as good as the year ago. Obviously, a lot happened within our quarter because December markets took a nosedive and recovered in January and February. So as far as the fourth quarter goes, I think based on the trend of the last three months, it's probably anybody's guess. But we are on the new accounting standard, which will require us to mark-to-market our equity securities and run it through the income statement. So to the extent, that's an issue we will certainly highlight that after the fourth quarter. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. And we're working with our audit committee and our auditors on whether or not it's appropriate to carve that out every quarter because it's a non-operating item. And as I mentioned in January, the equity portfolio of our captive insurance companies as this applies to is about $100 million. And so we'll have and communicate the consistent manner in which we'll address it in the future in terms of either carving it out or just highlighting it to questions like this. Operator Our next question on line comes from Mr. Mike Harrison from Seaport Global. Mike Harrison -- Seaport Global -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Mike Harrison -- Seaport Global -- Analyst Frank, you noted in the press release that energy was a positive in the North America industrial business. I was wondering if you can give maybe a little bit more detail on that, what specific product lines it's driving and how sustainable do you think that strength could be? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. In particular, our Carboline business, which serves energy markets pretty broadly, oil and gas, and pipelines, refineries, windmill blades. And so they have various product lines that are focused on either pipelines, which is in-ground or associated with chemical facilities. Our Fibergrate business, which provides FRP grading, which is corrosion and weather-resistant has had a good result in the energy markets as well. So those are the principal product lines. Mike Harrison -- Seaport Global -- Analyst And looking pretty sustainable going out through the next couple of quarters? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, we think so. I mean, obviously, raw materials -- not raw materials, oil prices have been volatile. But as the folks on this call know, there was a period of time when the oil industry and the energy markets cut back meaningfully not only on expansion but on maintenance. And it feels like we're back to a normal maintenance spend, period of time. Mike Harrison -- Seaport Global -- Analyst OK. And then, I wanted to also ask about the consumer business. You alluded in the past to some contracts that were keeping you from raising price and that those had run their course and expected to get some price traction. Did we start to see that? Or is that trickling in? Maybe just an update there. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. We had some commitments associated with line reviews and other commitments that inhibit our ability to get price while we were seeing significant raw material cost increases. And the last areas of RPM to get some price increases have been in our consumer businesses at the end of our third quarter. And so that will help our fourth quarter, and it's much needed and trailed the rest of RPM. Mike Harrison -- Seaport Global -- Analyst All right. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question on line come from Silke Kueck from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Silke. Silke Kueck -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Good morning. How are you? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good. Silke Kueck -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst The first question I have is a cash flow question. So in your press release, it says, like, year to date, your MAP-related initiatives was, like, a $0.50 headwind to sort of like a -- booked it like a nonrecurring item, and so maybe that's like $80 million or $90 million pre-tax. What do you expect in the fourth quarter in terms of charges? And what are the cash outflows related to that that may still have to come? Like, if you already spent all of it? Or what are the outflows that may come in the fourth quarter or next year? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. You should expect continuing outflows in terms of consulting and professional fees, which is categorized by Rusty in this other category, and that's running $6 million or $8 million a quarter. In some quarters it will be more, in some quarters it'll be less, and that will be ongoing for a period of time. And then the charges that we will continue to incur, particularly in fiscal '20, will be related to plant closures and/or distribution consolidation. And a portion of that will be noncash asset write-offs, and a big portion of that will be severance associated with those plant closures and related terminations. So we would expect to see those costs continue in '20. In July, we will provide more detail by category of our expected closure costs and what of those will be cash, and what are noncash. The other category is ERP implementations, and we'll have to get our head around that one because there are some debate as to how much of that ERP money we would have spent anyways versus what is being spent or accelerated because of our MAP to Growth initiatives. I think, previously, we've talked about a total program cost in the $120 million to $140 million range and the cash cost being in the $80 million to $90 million range. And we'll provide details in July of how much of that has been spent and an estimate of what's to come. Silke Kueck -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst OK. That's helpful. The second question I have is related to the Rust-Oleum and True Value initiative. That was just like put in place. So it's something that's new, especially to understand, and True Value has, I don't know, 4,500 stores, something like that. And what's the sell-through that you expect? Is it something like $10,000 a store, and the opportunity is like $45 million or that's way too optimistic or it's way too low? Or like any additional color that you may have? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, not really. I mean, without being disrespectful, it's kind of way too in the weeds and for obvious reasons, we have avoided talking as much as possible about specific customers. A year ago, that was hard to do with some of the strategic changes, supply wise in our marketplace. But I had commented earlier that we had picked up market share in the hardware store chain, in small project paints with our consumer segment. And that's been true, and that should benefit our fourth quarter and that we've also regained some big box of share that was lost last spring, and some of that's coming back to us. So the consumer businesses are doing a nice job in managing their categories, which we lead in. And we have formidable competitors. Their focus tends to be more on gallon goods and retail paint stores as opposed to the specialty products that we focus on. And that's allowed us to gain share in hardware and regain some lost share in big box. Silke Kueck -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst If I may ask the question, in an one other way. So if I look at your fourth-quarter guidance and I look at the guidance for the consumer growth for the fourth quarter. Do you think the underlying demand is something like 2%? If you like strip out the business wins maybe and what the pricing is, sort of, like 2%? Or do you think it's better than that or worse than that? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Our forecast for the fourth quarter consumer is in the mid to high single digits, that will all be organic. Silke Kueck -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst It will be organic. It includes the price and business wins? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That's correct. And so it should be a solid fourth quarter for our consumer segment. Silke Kueck -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst I think the last question -- Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I mean, in terms of the quarter, it will offset what we anticipate to be a challenging comp in some regional challenges in our largest segment, which is industrial. Silke Kueck -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst That sounds fair. The last question I have is on the specialty segment. Nudura is like in annual sales, it's like maybe $50 million, and it's seasonally slow in the February quarter and then it's probably a more normal for the May quarter. And so if you were to get, I don't know, like, $10 million or $12 million Nudura-related sales, like, that would be like 5% growth in the specialty segment. So why is your outlook so conservative in terms of modest growth? It's just that the initial benefit would be 5%? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No. I mean, we built that up from our businesses. And in our specialty segment, it's a real cross-current of fluorescent pigment. I mean you know all the different product lines. So I think they're expecting a modest single-digit growth. And I can't answer that specifically right now. I don't know maybe Rusty does, if it's versus a tough comp last year. Rusty? Rusty Gordon -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. I think another factor you should consider is FX will actually be going against us. So that will impact the sales growth. And with the momentum, this year has been low organic growth. They were the first to get price out of the box, so we'll start lapping the anniversary of price increases so that impact may tail off a bit too. Silke Kueck -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Thanks, sir. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Operator Our next question on line comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Steve Byrne -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Good morning, Frank. When you rolled out the MAP to Growth initiative last fall, you put out some margin targets. Were you anticipating some slippage in margins in this fiscal year? And what's your level of conviction on hitting, say, that 16% EBIT margin looking out two years? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. I think that's a great question, and I think we and our all industry experienced some challenges this year that we did not fully anticipate. So when we get to the end of our current fiscal year, May 31, I think people are seeing and will start to believe the good momentum that we're building, but we'll be a little bit behind the curve in terms of our margin targets. We'll have a better sense of that in July. And the element of that is not a function of if we get there, it would really be a function of timing. So are we going to get there on exactly the timing that we've talked about? And then the other element is giving the pluses and minuses of building an operating improvement plan, can we find additional savings that would will compensate for what is a slower start relative to the fiscal '19 margins that we anticipated when we put this plan together on October and November versus where we're going to end up the year. Steve Byrne -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst And just to expand on that Frank, when you say the potential additional savings, are you looking at different areas to potentially integrate? I don't know whether it's facility headquarters or distribution, or commercial. Are you looking at some other levers to pull? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Not necessarily. We do have some opportunities in G&A that we're looking at. I think the other area that we're excited about, and this is not going to happen, as of the December 31, 2020, or even May 31, 2021 time frame. But the manufacturing improvements and continuous improvement initiatives that we're rolling out are having a really good effect. And when the MAP to Growth timeline stops relative to the communicated, kind of, target finish line that we have, our continuous improvement programs will not. And there's some growing enthusiasm about our ability to add to that $75 million manufacturing and operations target. It's outside of our MAP to Growth timeline, but it's real. And so there's a lot of enthusiasm there. And a lot of the things that we're doing, when they're effective, will not only impact margins relative to financial targets but will change our culture in some fundamental ways, particularly, in how we allocate capital to fixed assets and how we measure performance and efficiency on the plant floor and that will continue beyond this program. Steve Byrne -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst And just one last one for you, Frank. You've got a lot of on your plate right now. Would you consider bringing in any new resources to help drive this restructuring program, given Steve's challenges right now? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, we would expect Steve to be back in the saddle, hopefully, sometime mid to late summer. And as it relates to new resources, Gordy Hyde, leading our manufacturing and operations efforts. We have added four process engineers under corporate staff that work directly for him. We have, on the procurement side, taken four or five of our top procurement people out of our operations, put them on the corporate payroll. And we've added an additional resource there. And so we are adding some really good talent in the procurement and the manufacturing continuous improvement areas to, again, not only help us achieve our goals as they'd been laid out but really help us fundamentally change our procurement process and our manufacturing and operations focus on an ongoing basis. Steve Byrne -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Very good. Thank you. Operator Our next question on line comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Arun Viswanathan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first off, it's just on price real quickly. Given your comments earlier, as far as crude goes back up, but maybe the raw is still kind of settling down. Is that a fair, guess assessment? And would you think that you need to go out with further pricing as the year goes on? So should we expect, kind of, an increasing contribution from price in future quarters? Or how should we think about that? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. That's a great question. And so here is how we think about it. As I mentioned earlier, sequentially, we're seeing a second quarter where raw materials quarter over quarter are going down by low single digits. Year over year, we're still up. Hopefully, that will even out in Q4, certainly that's our expectation. Much of the price increase that we've experienced was developed throughout the fiscal year. And the last pieces, as I mentioned earlier, were in consumer. So I think we'll get the full benefit of price for sure in the first half of the new fiscal year, and then we'll start to annualize price increases as we go through the year across RPM. The area that would drive additional price increases is what's happening in not only raw materials but freight, labor. There is a higher level of inflation across every business, at least in United States, relative to employment and labor costs. And it will be interesting to see how that plays out as well. Arun Viswanathan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. And in the consumer business, I think you've noted some weakness in the small project category over the last couple of years at different times. Possibly some of it due to competitive pressures. Have you seen either, kind of, moderation in those competitive pressures, any benefits to you guys? Have you been able to place where you're going with Varathane? And then as a second part, if competitive pressures haven't subsided, do you think that the DIY channel itself is going to continue to be weak just given low unemployment? Or how should we think about how the DIY channel and consumer segment, kind of, trends from a volume perspective over the next couple of quarters? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. First of all, it's an intensely competitive area. There's some strong regional players and a lot of big and bigger than us industry players that we compete with every day. The other thing that we suffered through last year, in particular, in Q4 and end of June, was extraordinarily wet weather, which camped down POS. I mentioned earlier on the call, the early read on consumer takeaway is pretty good. So the first couple weeks of our fourth quarter, we're seeing a real strong POS in small project paint. And combined with market share gains, we should have a nice recovery in our consumer business that would remind folks that we also took out a significant chunk of SG&A in consumer in the fourth quarter of last year. And two of the plant closures that we have announced and have been completed were in our consumer segment. So we've done a lot of work there on the cost side, and we picked up market share. And we're seeing better POS, at least, at the start of the fourth quarter than we've seen in four or five quarters. And so it's all pointing in the right direction. Weather could impact that in the fourth quarter. I think that's the only element that would negate what feels like good momentum. Arun Viswanathan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. And then just lastly, if I may. You mentioned some continued softness in Europe. Any chance that that could turn around, I guess, later as we go through the year? And then maybe if you can just give us a one line or two in industrial in North America and Brazil and if you're doing any encouragement by those markets or outside by those markets? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. We don't anticipate things improving in Europe. And if there was a Brexit deal that made everybody happy, that might buoy spirits across Europe and help things move in the right direction, but we're not planning on that. As it relates to Latin America, I think that we're seeing some spikiness from one month to the next. And in this case, I think it's good, particularly in Brazil, at where we have our vehicle business, our largest presence in Latin America. As the economy turned down in Brazil and geopolitical issues hit, we saw some spikiness that ultimately was a volatility indicator of a significant downward trend. Now we're seeing some spikiness not only in Brazil but in other parts of Latin America, which I'm hopeful is like a volatility indicator of a significant movement in the right direction. And so the feeling on the ground there is more positive than it's been in a couple years. We're not consistently seeing it in our results yet although we're hopeful. Arun Viswanathan -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Our next question on line comes from Mr. Kevin Hocevar from Northcoast Research. Kevin Hocevar -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst Hey, good morning, everybody. Just wanted some clarification on the Slide 5, the new year-to-date estimate run rate of $104 million up from the initial targeted $83 million. And you maintain that $290 million. Is that implying that you're realizing savings faster and perhaps pulling some savings forwards from future waves, and that's the reason for the raise? Or are you generating more savings than you initially expected which could be incremental? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That's a great question that we struggle with here, and that's why we have not changed our long-term target. I think it's way too early to decide that after being at this for essentially four months, five months, that we're not only ahead of the curve in terms of timing in the first phase but that we're actually adding to the whole program. So I think on the manufacturing piece, we're a little bit ahead of the curve. On the procurement piece, we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we were. As we get into next year, we hope to provide more detail, and I think we'll have a better answer to that question because it is one that we are struggling with internally in terms of what is being off to good start but feeling like maybe we're accelerating some of the early benefits. In procurement, in particular, I think there'll be a point at which we will have achieved what is possible with a new approach, and the rest of it will be really a function of what happens in the commodity cycle. Kevin Hocevar -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst OK. And then in the guidance, you give an expectation for consumer segment margin recovery starting in the fourth quarter but didn't mention that any similar verbiage in the other segments. So the expectation that those other segments have, flattish or something like that margins, where consumer is really the one that's going to see the nice improvements there? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No. I would expect to see margin recovery in all three of our segments in the fourth quarter. It will be a function of mix in part. So the elements that are impacting our gross margins are really three things. The raw material cost headwinds which year over year continuing that should start to mitigate as we get into the fourth quarter and the rest of 2020, the impact of our price increases and the positive impacts of our MAP to Growth initiatives. So I would expect margin improvement in each of our three segments in the fourth quarter. It will be most pronounced in consumer because our consumer segment was the first to execute on SG&A, cost cutting, and then our first plant closures out of the box were in consumers as well. And we'll also be annualizing an easier comp both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Kevin Hocevar -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst OK. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator Our final question comes from Mr. Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Brandon Bleile -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst This is Brandon on for Mike. So I know you guys have talked about international weakness, specifically in Europe. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the positive momentum in North America, specifically the U.S. What are your expectations for demand in the fourth quarter and maybe how that moves into fiscal-year 2020? Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. As we had commented earlier, the energy markets that we serve seem to be pretty solid, more back to a normal level of maintenance spending. The activity in construction markets has been a little bit volatile, but I think recent communications or information around housing starts and commercial construction suggest that that's going to continue to be positive. And just like in our consumer segment, we've talked about, we've got some new product areas. There's an opportunity to leverage some of the Nudura business growth in cooperation with our Tremco businesses. The AlphaGuard roof restoration product is continuing to grow at double digits. And so some of it is market-related, and some of it is a continuation of some of the new product introductions and new innovation that is coming out of our industrial segment. So we see that as positive. And most of the new product introductions that we're talking about happened, also be North America because those are our biggest markets and where we have our largest sales and distribution effort. Brandon Bleile -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Great color. Thank you. That's all. Operator We have no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Sullivan for closing remarks. Frank Sullivan -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much for joining us on today's call. We appreciate all the questions around our MAP to Growth program and hope to provide you with even more details when we release our fourth-quarter results and provide outlook for our 2020 fiscal year on July 22. We plan to renew our tradition of releasing the earnings in New York, most likely at the New York Stock Exchange with an investor luncheon, where we will also have our segment Presidents to talk in more detail about their expectations for growth in their segment and the impact of MAP to Growth, not only in RPM but in consolidated basis but also by each of our segments as well. Thank you very much for your interest in RPM and your investment in RPM. And have a great day.

670," By Rami Ayyub HAIFA, Israel, April 5 (Reuters) - Some of Israel's young Arab citizens are calling for a boycott of Tuesday's parliamentary election, dismayed by a recent law which they say reduces them to second-class citizens. The pro-boycott activists, many of whom identify as Palestinian, have tried in the past to persuade others among Israel's Arab minority not to vote. Leaders of Israel's main Arab parties are pushing for their voters to turn out, fearing a boycott would weaken the 21-percent Arab minority's representation in parliament, and boost Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's election chances. Ignoring the party leaders, dozens of activists from the ""Popular Campaign to Boycott the Zionist Knesset Elections"" have been handing out leaflets in the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, which has a mixed Jewish and Arab population, and in smaller Arab towns and villages. ""This is an attempt to boycott the body that actively tries to erase our Palestinian identity,"" said Joul Elias, a student from Haifa who turned up to distribute flyers in Wadi Nisnas, a majority Arab neighborhood in the city. Israel's Arab minority comprises mainly descendants of the Palestinians who remained in their communities or were internally displaced after the 1948 war that surrounded Israel's creation. According to figures released by Israel'sCentral Bureau of Statistics, there were 1.9 million Arabs in Israel's roughly 9 million population at the start of 2019. Most were Muslims, Christians or Druze. Jews made up 74.3 percent of the population.  WAKE-UP CALL Despite holding Israeli citizenship, many Arabs say their communities, from the fertile Galilee in the north to the Negev desert in the south, face discrimination in areas such as health, education and housing. Netanyahu's ruling Likud party counters that its 15 billion shekel ($4.19 billion) investment plan for the Arab sector ""is the largest such commitment in Israel's history,"" according to Eli Hazan, Likud's foreign affairs director. But Netanyahu rekindled Arab resentment in March when he wrote on Instagram that ""Israel is not a state of all its citizens"". It was a reference, he said, to the new law, and the country being the homeland of the Jewish people. Many in the Arab community saw the Instagram post as an echo of divisive comments he made in the 2015 election. Hours before the polls closed on election day that year, Netanyahu said that Arabs were flocking ""in droves"" to cast ballots. This was an attempt to prod any complacent right-wing supporters to get out and vote for him. ""The nation-state law was like a wake-up call for many people, making them realise this country will never be a country for all its citizens,"" said Muhannad Abu Ghosh, 42, a pro-boycott activist from Haifa. But Ayman Odeh, an Arab legislator who heads the Hadash party, says that engagement is key to bringing about political changes that will benefit the Arab minority. ""Our challenge, number one through five, is to increase the number of people who vote,"" he said. He said some Arabs would, as they have in the past, vote for non-Arab centre- or left-wing parties, but that even those votes ""play a significant role in fighting right-wing extremism in Israel.""  ARAB LEGISLATORS Arabs have served in Israel's parliament since the country's founding, but low turnout and other factors have typically left them under-represented in the 120-seat body. No Arab party has served in a governing coalition, meaning they have little say in shaping Israeli policies. In the 2015 election, Israel's four Arab-dominated political parties united to form a ""Joint List"" that won 13 seats - their biggest representation yet. But this time around they are divided, which is likely to further deter an already dismayed electorate from voting, say political analysts. Arab voter turnout is expected to be just 51 percent, down from 64 percent in 2015, according to a recent poll from the Konrad Adenauer Program for Jewish-Arab Cooperation at Tel Aviv University. The poll projects nationwide turnout of 70 percent. ""The majority of Palestinians in Israel consider the Knesset election as a practical tool. If it helps them, they will go and vote,"" said As'ad Ghanem, a professor of political science at the University of Haifa. ""This time, with the collapse of the Joint List and frustration with discriminatory practices, voter turnout will be low."" Ahmad Tibi, a veteran Arab legislator whose Ta'al party has forged an alliance with Odeh, says Arab parties are likely to lose two Knesset seats in this election. But he doesn't see the nation state law or political division as a reason to boycott the vote. ""You can be a critic, you can have reservations, you can be angry at Arab parties or Arab [ministers],"" Tibi said. ""But to be nonchalant and to sit aside is not the solution."" Still, the boycott movement's members, many of whom voted in previous elections, believe that grassroots activism is a more effective agent of change than voting. Rula Nasr-Mazzawi, 43, a former activist with the Arab party Balad, says she left the faction and joined the boycott out of frustration with Arab parties' divisions in the face of what she described as Israel's ""racist policies"". ""The parties stopped working for the people. They are just clinging onto their own seats and their own power,"" she said.  ($1 = 3.5830 shekels) ",24.17999999999938,1

For more details on this strategy, click here About John Neff : While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as ""relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative."" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.

678," BERLIN, April 5 (Reuters) - German industrial output rose by 0.7 percent in February as mild weather helped a surge in construction activity but manufacturing production dipped, giving little hope to Europe's largest economy after a run of negative news. Germany is suffering from trade friction and Brexit angst after narrowly avoiding recession last year. Leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for 2019 growth on Thursday and warned a long-term upswing had come to an end. The rise in output exceeded expectations for a 0.5 percent increase on the month. January's reading was revised up to show no change from a previously reported contraction of 0.8 percent, Statistics Office figures showed. ""The construction sector remains in a boom. The relatively mild weather contributed to the good result in February."" Industrial orders in Germany fell by the biggest margin in more than two years in February, slumping 4.2 percent, data showed on Thursday. The overall gain in industrial output was boosted by a 6.8 percent surge in construction. Manufacturing output declined by 0.2 percent in February. ""A warm thank you to the construction sector. More generally speaking, German industry remains an international reason for concern,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. ""Brexit woes and the global slowdown have a stranglehold over German industry."" On Thursday, Germany's leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for 2019 growth by more than half and warned that the economy could slow much more if Britain quits the European Union without an agreement. Germany is in its 10th year of economic expansion, but narrowly skirted a recession at the end of last year and posted its weakest growth in five years in 2018. Its export-orientated economy is being slowed by the trade and Brexit headwinds. Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly said she will ""fight until the last hour"" for an orderly Brexit.

The operator of Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, which has been earmarked for privatisation, on Thursday outlined investment plans designed to boost revenue at the two Paris hubs by 40-50 percent by 2025.

680," By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 5 (Reuters) - The crown is expected to strengthen by 2 percent versus the euro in the coming year if the Czech central bank (CNB) continues to increase interest rates to fight inflation, according to a Reuters poll of analysts. That is the only meaningful gain projected for a Central European currency in the April 1-3 poll of 41 analysts. The leu could shed almost 1 percent relative to levels at Thursday noon, to 4.8 versus the euro, depressed by the unpredictability of Romania's fiscal and tax policy and a widening current account deficit. Softer rhetoric from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has reduced pressure on the region's monetary authorities in recent weeks to tighten their own policy. The outlook hinges on whether recent fears of economic slowdown in the world and the euro zone, mainly Germany, ease, analysts said. Investors will also look closely at economic data in the Czech Republic and Hungary, where annual inflation has exceeded the midpoint of inflation target ranges. The poll predicted the crown would firm to 25.2 versus the euro in the next year, a 2 percent rise from mid-Thursday levels. Morgan Stanley economist Pasquale Diana said a weaker economic outlook in Czech trading partners and a change in the CNB's fx forecasting methods mixed greater uncertainty into rate forecasts. ""(But) our own forecast shows two hikes this year,"" he said in a note. Like elsewhere in Central Europe, robust growth in wages has driven up inflation in Poland, despite signs of some slowdown in robust economic growth across the region. But running at 1.7 percent in March, Polish inflation stayed near the bottom of the central bank's (NBP) 1.5-3.5 percent target range. Some Polish rate setters are worried about the inflationary impacts of fiscal stimulus by the government, which faces national elections late this year. But NBP governor Adam Glapinski reiterated on Wednesday that the bank's 1.5 percent benchmark rate was unlikely to change for years. The median forecast in the poll predicted a 0.2 percent firming in the zloty to 4.285 versus the euro over the next 12 months, weaker than the 4.255 projected a month ago. Hungary's central bank raised its overnight deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.05 percent, but kept its base rate on hold at 0.9 percent and dropped its hawkish bias last week, sending the forint into a plunge. The currency stabilized around the 320 line versus the euro this week, and the poll sees it staying at that level over the next year, compared with 317.5 predicted on the 12-month horizon a month ago. ""These are point forecasts, and there may be significant deviations in the exchange rate,"" said Erste Group analyst Orsolya Nyeste, adding that changes in the inflation outlook or the guidance of major central banks may cause swings. ING senior economist Peter Virovacz said the forint could weaken to 330 against the euro by the middle of 2019 after the NBH's ""dovish hike"" and ""mixed communication"" as core inflation could pick up to 3.9 percent by the summer. Radomir Jac, chief economist of Generali Investments, said solid fundamentals, accompanied by current account surpluses or small deficits in the region, could strengthen the crown, the forint and the zloty. ""Once the external environment becomes more stable, then both the domestic interest rates and fundamental story of the national economies will lead the regional currencies towards some gains,"" he said.

681," April 5 (Reuters) - Britain'sCo-operative Group predicted a challenging 2019 on Friday as it reported largely unchanged annual pretax profit, citing strong competition and continuing doubts over the shape of Britain's departure from the European Union. The UK's sixth largest supermarket operator, which also has side businesses ranging from insurance to undertaking, said total revenue for the year to Jan. 5 rose 14 percent to 10.2 billion pounds ($13.37 billion), driven by strong food sales and the acquisition of the Nisa convenience chain. Food like-for-like sales rose 4.4 percent in the period. Co-op, which has been healing since 2013 when a crisis in its then banking unit nearly brought it to its knees, said it was planning for various Brexit scenarios. The country's biggest mutually-owned business said underlying pretax profit remained flat at 43 million pounds, however, pretax profit from continuing operations rose 27 percent to 93 million pounds. Co-op said that it had been forced to back off previous plans to partially re-finance a 450 million pound Eurobond expiring in July 2020 due to the impact of Brexit jitters on debt market pricing.

Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Melanie. Good morning, everyone. Our 50%-owned, federally permitted Donlin Gold project is in Alaska, the second largest gold-producing in the -- state in U.S. and is located approximately 300 miles west of Anchorage, as shown on Slide 4. On Slide 5, we highlight two state permits received in the first quarter. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation issued the Final Waste Management permit and the Alaska Department of Natural Resources issued the final reclamation and closure plan approval in January. We are advancing other state permits regarding the project's transportation corridor and pipeline. Additionally, we are commencing work needed for the Alaska Dam safety certificates that will carry on into 2020. Permitting largely complete. We are increasing our focus on continuing to integrate scoping-level optimization work into a study that will become the basis for an updated project development plan. Slide 6 outlines the permit work that the team has already accomplished over the past year, heavily derisking the Donlin Gold project while staying on track with our strategy. With federal permits in hand, we have the right, but not the obligation to conduct work on site. Highlighted in green are the two most recent state permits that we received in the first quarter, which I mentioned in the previous slide. We will keep you updated as other permits come in. A big part of our activities in Alaska is working with both Calista and TKC, our native corporation partners. Over the past few months, we continued our outreach efforts and met with tribal councils and key stakeholders in the YK region. In the first quarter, NovaGold and Donlin Gold participated in several community activities. Some of the highlights include a meeting with career counselors in the lower Kuskokwim School District with the goal of engaging youth in an upcoming career fair and participating in the Alaska forum on the environment, where we received the Green Star certification certificate that recognizes businesses for their efforts in sustainable environmental stewardship. Additionally, Donlin Gold hosted their Annual Safety Expo ahead of the Iron Dog Race in Alaska. We attended the State of Alaska legislative session in Juneau, where we met with state representatives and senators as well as the newly elected governor Michael Dunleavy. Transparent and open communications with local communities is an essential part of our day-to-day responsibilities in the region. And with that, I'll turn it over to our chief financial officer, David Ottewell. David Ottewell -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Greg. Slide 8 highlights our first-quarter operating performance. For the first quarter, we reported a $6.3 million net loss, $1.9 million lower than the prior year. The net loss decreased primarily due to lower share-based compensation costs, lower permitting costs at Donlin Gold, increased interest income and accretion of notes receivable, partially offset by higher interest expense on the promissory note payable to Barrick and foreign exchange losses. NovaGold 's cash flow highlights are outlined on Slide 9. In the first quarter, we spent $5.2 million, $1.8 million lower than the prior year quarter. Total spending decreased due to lower permitting costs at Donlin Gold, interest -- increased interest income on term deposits and the sale of Galore Creek in July 2018, partially offset by withholding taxes paid on vested PSUs. We ended the quarter with $161.8 million in cash and term deposits. In 2019, we continue to expect to spend a total of $24 million, including $13 million for our share of Donlin Gold and $11 million for corporate, general, and administrative costs. At Donlin Gold, 2019 spending is expected to increase with the commencement of field work and detailed engineering to support the application for Alaska Dam safety certificates. Looking ahead, as a result of our sale of Galore Creek last year, we have $100 million receivable from Newmont with an additional $75 million contingent on Galore Creek construction. Back to you, Greg. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Dave. Now for a brief overview of Donlin Gold. With its significant size, high grade, incredible output, and a mine life measured in decades, along with excellent exploration upside, strong local partnerships, and jurisdictional appeal, Donlin Gold is expected to be a pace-setter in the precious metals industry for years to come. I will speak to each of these attributes in the coming slides. Beginning with size, on Slide 12, we compared Donlin to 17 other development stage projects in the industry. And if you look at the peer group average, with 39 million ounces Donlin is unique and more than five times the size of the average peer group. Another key attribute shown on Slide 13 is the outstanding quality of the deposit. Donlin's grade at 2.25 grams is double the industry average. Given the rapid decline in gold, reserves, and grade, deposits such as this are needed to sustain the industry. Beyond the size and quality, Donlin Gold has longevity with an anticipated production profile of greater than 1 million ounces a year, over a 27-year mine life. With the mine life measured in decades, once in production, the project is expected to be the largest contributor in the region and will bring great benefits to its stakeholders for many years to come. The bubble chart on Slide 15 shows the scale of the project and how it compares to 10 largest gold-producing mines in the world. Only six are expected to produce more than a million ounces a year this year, further illustrating that projects like Donlin are very scarce and needed to replenish the industry's diminishing reserves. Slide 16 depicts the challenges of finding new gold deposits, as defined by the blue bars. Gold is getting harder to find. And even as the prices moved up, and exploration spending increased, there have been very few new discoveries. That puts Donlin in a great position when gold resumes its upward trend. Given that it can take on average over 20 years to go from discovery to production, we are in a great spot with the federally permitted projects and control of its development time line. As shown on Slide 17, we have roughly 1,400 holes in this deposit with over 90% of them being core holes, giving us a very detailed understanding of the geology and mineralization. Beyond the drilling completed to-date, there is still substantial exploration potential along the 8 kilometer mineralized belt, as shown on Slide 18. The ACMA and Lewis deposits, which are marked in the blue area, contain the 39 million ounce resource and only occupy about 3 kilometers of the 8 kilometer belt. When the time is right, we will resume exploration drilling. Donlin brings exceptional leverage to a rising gold price, as shown on Slide 19. In the current environment, we have a project with modest rates of return that increase substantially in a rising gold price environment. We have the flexibility and patience to wait for the right time to proceed with development. Another unique aspect of the project is that our property is located on private land that's owned by two Alaska native corporations. Calista owns the mineral estate and TKC owns the surface rights. This land was set aside for mining-related activities and transferred to the native corporations for their economic self-determination. We have life-of-mine agreements with both partners, who have been involved and supportive from the very start. We are thankful to Calista and TKC for their support. And their commitment to Donlin has been key to our success. As Slide 21 shows, being in a geopolitically safe jurisdiction is another key attribute. Alaska offers jurisdictional stability and welcomes responsible new resource development. With permitting largely complete, the time line for development, as shown on Slide 22 is within the project owner's direct control. Our focus is shifting more to finalizing optimization work that will ultimately be reflected in a study that will serve as the basis for an updated development plan. An important part of our engagement effort includes outreach to our shareholders and investors throughout the year. Over 50% of our shares are held by our top shareholders, as shown on Slide 23, for whom we are extremely grateful, not only for their support of our strategy but their foresight in superior gold leverage opportunities that this company represents through Donlin. NovaGold strives to create a balanced development plan that enhances economic growth, provides a safe and healthy workplace, and preserves traditional lifestyles while bringing tangible and long-lasting benefits to our community partners. As shown on Slide 24, we implement our social responsibility programs and commitments in a number of important areas on an ongoing basis. We are all, to one extent or another, vested in contributing our time to various outreach efforts in Alaska. We have moved Donlin Gold further up the value chain and look forward to the next chapter as we advance the project. It's our belief that our company is truly well-positioned to create value for our shareholders. To conclude, with a strong balance sheet of $162 million in cash, a unique asset in a safe jurisdiction, the right partnerships and people to take this project forward, I have no doubt that Donlin has the potential to become one of the most coveted assets in the precious metals industry. Operator, we can now open the line for questions. Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Lucas Pipes of B. Riley FBR. Lucas Pipes -- B. Riley FBR, Inc. -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, everyone. How are you doing? I wanted to follow up a little bit, Greg, on the optimization study that you mentioned. Could you share with us a little bit more in regards to timing? And then what parts you're most focused on at this time. Thank you very much. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Luke -- Lucas. Thanks for joining the call. Our partner -- we've been working very closely with them in the last couple of months. As you might imagine, there is a lot of data for the new executives to get their arms around and we're continuing to pursue that with them and advance our execution plan for this year. But I think we're still some months out from committing to a firm gate on when Barrick will finish getting their arms around the project. And as they do, we'll keep everyone posted. Lucas Pipes -- B. Riley FBR, Inc. -- Analyst Excellent. Thank you. And then you've touched on it in terms of the major changes we've seen in the industry with consolidation. Greg, what do you think could this mean for Donlin and NovaGold? Would appreciate your perspective on that. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Lucas, we don't really give a lot of thought to what's happening around us in the industry. I think it's fascinating. And really this year, we're financially strong and we're in a great spot to continue to move our project forward. Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board Hi, Lucas. It's Tom. Can everyone hear me? Lucas Pipes -- B. Riley FBR, Inc. -- Analyst Hey, Tom. I can hear you, yes. Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board Great. I'll add just one wrinkle to Greg's answer. When we look back upon the value proposition and the upside potential of Donlin being unlocked, I believe that I will be proven to be right that the Barrick-Randgold merger is indeed the White Swan that I referred to in my last comments in the conference call that preceded this one as well as in my letter to shareholders The first of that White Swan's offspring, little swans, are called cygnets. The first white cygnet from that is what we just witnessed between Newmont and Barrick. Twenty-five years ago, the frontier gold rush, the go where the gold is phenomenon that led from the United States being the most coveted jurisdiction for gold mines to people moving into Peru, when Newmont went in with Buenaventura on Yanacocha and, of course, Freeport to Indonesia and then ultimately Africa and everywhere else. As you know, for a number of years, I believe that that era is over. And again, I have standing. It was very, very good for me in a number of these countries. But about seven or eight years ago, we realized that it was ultimately all going to come around to jurisdiction. That if one really wanted to be able to get maximum premium valuation for assets, not to mention the ability to sleep at night, you're going to want to be in safe jurisdictions: North America, Australia, and the like. And so we withdrew from almost everything in the developing world. And the reason was we thought resource nationalism would rear its head. And it's the nature of resource nationalism, that it's not something that could be contained. And when someone sees that their neighbor over the fence is getting a better deal from a mining company, they demand the same and so on and so on. Before the frontier spirit took hold, U.S. assets were valued primarily using a zero percent discount rate. Because of their safety and also growth potential, they were arbitraged against riskier jurisdictions like Canada, Australia, and South Africa. What just happened between Barrick and Newmont is a watershed event. And every investor and analyst in mining should have absolutely no doubt that a major, major game changer has just occurred. What Barrick did with Newmont is they have highlighted that the most attractive assets in the world are in the United States. Now Nevada, of course, is the No. 1 gold producer in the country but No. 2 is Alaska. And we believe that we're already on track when one day we recommence drilling to be able to overtake the reserves of Nevada. Now obviously, if there's more drilling in Nevada, all power to them. But the point is this, for NovaGold shareholders in particular and for shareholders of high-quality U.S. assets, the arm wrestling match that just took place over Nevada reaffirmed that the assets worth fighting for in the gold industry are in safe jurisdictions. Nevada obviously qualifies, so does Alaska. These are both places where research analysts, fund managers, and other stakeholders will be very happy to take their families without any risk. It's a place where investors know that when they go to sleep at night, when they wake up in the morning, whatever they thought they owned the night before they still own. It's a place where the rule of law isn't a novelty. We think that what just happened has validated our thesis that the United States would not only be coming back, but that it would be given the premier status in the world. Now the best way to play the rebirth of the American gold mining premium is through NovaGold. We are a 50% owner of an asset that will rival Nevada in terms of size, the grade we already know, the mine in one or two stages would actually be bigger than the goldmine in Nevada, at any single goldmine. Donlin could prove to be a multi-mine district. Remember, we have 45 million ounces identified on three kilometers of an 8 kilometer belt. And that eight kilometers represents maybe 5% of the total property. It's a quirk of history that it hasn't yet been explored, but there are other targets on this property. In other words Donlin could be in its own right, another Nevada. Now that's great enough but remember, the last deal that was made between Barrick and Newmont was 61.5-38.5, Barrick having operatorship. I'm sure that there is very good reason for all of that. What matters to us is that we are 50-50 with joint operatorship that gives neither party any advantage over the other, which means that we are a pure play on an asset that could one day rival Nevada and we have half of it with joint operatorship. One day when investors are coming back into the space, you can imagine the bullet points on the analys t report s, you can imagine what the bankers will be telling their clients, and brokers will be telling their clients. Would you like a half interest in the next Nevada? With Nevada now being on everybody's lips, as I said, this is the first White Swan. There may very well be others, but what has just happened will be that moment when people will go back and they said you know what they rang the bell for the NovaGold thesis. How quickly takes for people to come around to it? It doesn't really matter because once they do, the uplift, the complete reevaluation based on the jurisdiction, not to mention all of the other aspects that make Donlin in the aggregate unique is going to be a game changer. And so I just wanted to make sure that everyone understands what we just saw is not another ho-hum moment in the mining industry. It is as much a ringing of the bell as when Newmont went to Yanacocha, and unleashed the go to the gold -- go to where the gold is mentality. Fortunately, we have as much gold as any deposit you're likely to find in the rest of the world, which just happens to be [Inaudible]. It's in the best jurisdiction in the world. Lucas Pipes -- B. Riley FBR, Inc. -- Analyst Tom, thank you so much for that detailed description. It's great to hear that and great to hear that highlighted. Thank you. Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board Thank you, Lucas. Operator [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Terrence Moore, a private investor. Unidentified speaker Good morning, everyone. The first thing, I was looking at your measured and indicated. You got measured at 6 million -- roughly 6 million ounces, indicated 33 million ounces. Would you do me the honor of differentiating those two and explaining why the indicator is not in a measured? Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, good morning, Terrence, you've actually asked a question which would require a fairly in-depth answer. But I guess, the simplest way to put it is the function of the drill hole density. And I'd observe that we strictly adhere to the industry and statutory requirements on how we compute and report our reserves and resources. Unidentified speaker OK. Then while indicated, the vast amount -- your 39 million overwhelmingly is in indicated. Is indicated -- that does not have the sound of finality to it. So I know -- what my question is, is there possibility that you'll wind up with much less than 39 million ounces? Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Terrence, no. I think to give you more sense of the classification, there is measured and indicated then inferred. And only if you're looking for a category that's if you would say at-risk to either get increased or decreased, it's typically in the inferred. Measured and indicated are very, very solid. And I would direct you to our webpages, which have really very in-depth detailed technical descriptions of the criteria that supports each one of those various classifications. Unidentified speaker OK. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer And if you have trouble locating it, please feel free to reach out to us and we will direct you to the appropriate spot in our data. Unidentified speaker No. I've got it up on my computer now, I can find it. I appreciate that. Now my next question is what is the projected date for production to start if there is one? Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, Terrence, at this stage, we have not announced a development plan. It's our strategy to position this asset that when the prices and markets are right we're in the position to go forward. And, Tom, would you like to expand on that question little bit? Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board Did you look to me? Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board When the conditions are right, when the gold price is higher, can everyone hear me? Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Unidentified speaker Yes. Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board Hello? Unidentified speaker Hello. Yes, I can hear you. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, we can hear you, Tom. Unidentified speaker Are we still on? Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer We seem -- Terrence, we seem to have encountered a communication failure there. But really to answer your question a little bit more -- Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board I'm back on. Sorry about that. I hope you can hear me now. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Much better. Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board Much better, great. Basically, when the gold prices rise, and we'll know it when we see it. Don't ask me what that price is going to be. You'll see it in an explosion in share price, you'll see it in investor sentiment. People will understand that the next leg of the bull market is moving. That's when we and, of course, we have a partner and Barrick will make a construction decision. Unidentified speaker Tom, the reason I asked that is because I've been an investor in NovaGold for many years, literally many. And I remember -- and correct me if I'm mistaken, but my memory is usually pretty good that at one point, NovaGold was offered to buyout at $17 a share, which NovaGold turned down. And that was -- Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board That correct. That was before I was a shareholder in the company, by the way. That was 2006, when Barrick made a hostile bid, correct. I came into the company on December 31, 2008. It was a very, very different story at that time. The one thing that I can tell you is that if you've read the annual report, you will see that every promise we've ever made to investors from the time that we have come into the company, we have fulfilled each and every one of them. I don't think there are many companies that over the last decade would be able to say they haven't made one mistake. And the result is that we have a federally permitted project in the United States with one of the best management teams in this space. We haven't done anything to dilute shareholder value. On the contrary, we've spun off Trilogy, which is now a $0.25 billion company in its own right. We sold Galore, not for pennies but for real money. We're now a pure play on 50% of an asset that in its own right could rival Nevada. Now you've been an investor for a long time and you've clearly seen that the last decade has been very difficult for gold stocks over the most part. Nonetheless, what I would suggest is that where we are now in a position to be able to wait for the higher gold prices that will allow us to get the kind of great return that everyone should be looking for before they build a gold mine in this environment. We are, I think, better positioned than any other company in this industry. So I hope to be able to reward you. One thing, I can assure you. I sit exactly on your side of the table. If anything, you could say that the owner lives above the shop. I love the story more now than when we got into it 10 years ago and I was pretty excited then. But the fact that all of the boxes have been checked, the fact that we have been derisked. The fact that all of the upside is so very clearly obvious and that we are sitting with enough cash to be able to survive any downdraft in the industry that could devastate other companies that are producing or developing prematurely, in my view, this is exactly the kind of vehicle that you should be looking for. I know personally, this is exactly the kind of vehicle that I want. And I don't know if anyone that is better because if there were, I would be buying it. Unidentified speaker I appreciate that, and I'm still with the company. I've got a good position with you. But let me let me wrap this up because somebody else might have a question. I can't ask all the questions. You mentioned Galore Creek, which was one of the things I was going to bring up because you did not address that. You sold 50% Galore Creek, but we retained 50%. What is the status of Galore Creek as far as development? Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, Tom. I'll take that question. Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board Please take that one, Greg. Thank you. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Terrence, we had owned 50% of Galore Creek and it was co-owned by Teck. So now we sold 100% of our 50% interest. So Galore Creek is owned by Teck and Newmont. Unidentified speaker Oh, OK. All right. I did not understand it. I thought we still had 50% of it. Last thing, gentlemen, let me make a comment here. I am glad to see that Paulson is -- owns a lot of your stock because I am also in the Detour, and Detour was an absolute mess. It was a scam until Paulson took over the board and straightened that company up. So I have a lot of hope for Detour too under Paulson's leadership. So just thought I'd throw it in there that I think it's a good point that Mr. Paulson and his companies are heavily invested in NovaGold. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer We're very pleased to have them as shareholders and I'm sure your remarks will find their way to Paulson Group. Unidentified speaker I hope so. OK, gentlemen. Thank you very much. Sorry take up so much time. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer All right. Thank you. Tom Kaplan -- Chairman of The Board Thank you, Terrence. Greg Lang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you for your interest in NovaGold. We appreciate you taking the time to join our call. Thank you.

683," SEOUL, April 5 (Reuters) - LG Electronics Inc's operating profit likely fell by a smaller-than-expected 19 percent in the first quarter, even as losses in its mobile business and rising competition in the television segment pushed its revenue down to below consensus. Shares of the South Korean firm trimmed earlier gains after the news and turned down as much as 1.5 percent on Friday, in a broader market that was up 1.2 percent. The second-biggest TV set maker in the world, after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, estimated an operating profit of 899.6 billion won ($792.77 million) for the January-March period, versus 1.1 trillion won a year earlier. Revenue likely fell 1.4 percent to 14.9 trillion won, the South Korean firm said, below a 15.3 trillion won consensus. LG did not disclose further details of first-quarter operations and will announce full results in late April. Analysts said LG's longtime loss-generating smartphone business, in the red for seven quarters, and intensifying price competition in the global TV market likely weighed on earnings. ""LG's competitor Samsung recently cut prices for its TV products in a bid to get ahead as Chinese television makers have been rapidly catching up,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at BNK Securities. Analysts also have a dim view of LG's smartphone business and expect it to continue generating losses. LG held a 3 percent share of the global smartphone market in terms of shipment last year, according to a report from market tracker Counterpoint Research. The company plans to release its 5G-enabled smartphone in South Korea later this month. Mobile carriers in the country, which has one of the world's highest smartphone penetration rates, rolled out the latest wireless technology this week on Samsung's new 5G-enabled handset Galaxy S10. Samsung flagged earlier on Friday that it was heading for its lowest quarterly profit in more than two years as a glut in memory chips, slowing panel sales and rising competition in smartphones hit margins.

Yet we see a repeat of the first-quarter rally as unlikely, given a narrower path for risk assets to move higher . Risks that could knock markets off track include a resurgence of recession fears; inflation pressures that force the Federal Reserve to resume tightening; or a geopolitical shock-such as a U.S.-Europe trade showdown.

696," BUCHAREST, April 5 (Reuters) - The European Union economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Friday that Italy's economic situation was ""delicate"" and needed to be monitored closely. Arriving to a meeting of Euro Zone finance ministers in Bucharest, Moscovici cited non-EU figures pointing to no growth or even recession for Italy. ""These are figures that we need to follow very closely,"" he said. He added the Commission will issue new economic forecasts on May 7. In its latest estimates released in February, the Commission predicted a 0.2 percent growth for Italy this year. Moscovici said that Germany's slowdown ""may be temporary"", while Italy is in recession or close to recession, depending on the institutions that make the forecasts.

697," By Tim Hepher, Eric M. Johnson and Jamie Freed PARIS/SEATTLE/SINGAPORE, April 5 (Reuters) - Minutes after take-off, the pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX were caught in a bad situation. A key sensor had been wrecked, possibly by a bird strike. As soon as they retracted the flaps and slats, it began to feed faulty data into the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), designed to prevent stalls. Moments later, the Boeing Co jet hit the ground, killing all 157 people onboard after six minutes of flight. Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday that the pilots followed all the correct procedures in trying to keep MCAS from sending the plane into a fatal dive. But the full picture of what happened in the cockpit of Flight 302 on March 10 is emerging from the sparse commentary of a preliminary report and especially a newly released data plot showing how crew and technology interacted. The airline's youngest-ever captain, a 29-year-old with an impressive 8,100 hours flying time, and his rookie 25-year-old co-pilot may have gone against procedures by leaving the engines at full take-off power, according to data and other pilots. By the end, the aircraft was travelling at 500 knots (575 mph, 926 kph), far beyond its design limits. That and some other potential missteps may have left them unable to fight flawed Boeing software that eventually sent the jet into an uncontrollable dive, experts said after studying the data. ""Power being left in take-off power while levelling off at that speed is not a normal procedure,"" said one U.S. pilot, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. ""I can't imagine a scenario where you'd need to do that."" The Ethiopian Airlines crash, and another in Indonesia five months earlier, have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis as its top-selling jetliner is grounded worldwide, and Ethiopia scrambling to protect one of Africa's most successful companies. Boeing is working on an MCAS software fix and extra training that it says will prevent a repeat of such accidents. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday that both accidents were caused by a chain of events, ""with a common chain link being erroneous activation of the aircraft's MCAS function.""  BIRD STRIKE Sources who reviewed the crash data said the problems started barely 12 seconds after take-off. A sudden data spike suggests a bird hit the plane as it was taking off and sheared away a vital airflow sensor. As with the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, the damaged 'angle of attack' sensor, which tells pilots what angle the aircraft has relative to its forward movement, may have set off a volatile chain of events. In both cases, the faulty sensor tricked the plane's computer into thinking the nose was too high and the aircraft was about to stall, or lose lift. The anti-stall MCAS software then pushed the nose down forcefully with the aircraft's ""trim"" system, normally used to maintain level flight. The first time the MCAS software kicked in, the Ethiopian Airlines pilots quickly countered the movement by flicking switches under their thumbs - they had recognised the movements as the same type all flight crews had been warned about after the Lion Air flight. Safety officials say aviation accidents are rarely pinned entirely on either pilots or their technology, and a timeline showed the crew fully engaged in trying to save the aircraft. But data suggests they did not hold the buttons down long enough to fully counteract the computer's movements. At that point, they were a mere 3,000 feet above the airport, so low that a new warning - a computerised voice saying ""don't sink"" - sounded in the cabin. When MCAS triggered again, the jetliner's trim was set to push the nose down at almost the maximum level, while the control yoke noisily vibrated with another stall warning called a ""stick shaker."" This time, the pilots countered MCAS more effectively. But when they turned off the system - as they were instructed to do by Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the wake of the Lion Air disaster - the nose was still pointed downward, leaving the jetliner vulnerable. The combination of excess speed and cutting off the system while the plane was still leaning downwards meant up to 50 pounds of force would be needed to move the control column, and moving the manual trim wheels was impossible.  'PULL UP, PULL UP' The captain called out ""pull up"" three times. The co-pilot reported problems to air traffic control. In the meantime, the aircraft's speed remained abnormally high. The bird strike and loss of airflow data would have affected airspeed information too. In such cases, pilots know to turn off automatic engine settings and control thrust manually. But the report says ""the throttles did not move,"" without elaborating. Data confirms the engines stayed at nearly full power. Other 737 pilots say that made the crew's job tougher by making the controls much harder to move. ""You would never ever have full power for the whole flight,"" said Hart Langer, a veteran former senior vice president for flight operations at United Airlines. He and some other experienced pilots said there was an array of stressful factors sapping the pilots' attention, which Muilenburg addressed on Thursday. ""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high-workload environment,"" Muilenburg said. ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it."" Among the distractions was a ""clacker"" warning telling the pilots their aircraft was going too fast. As the nose gradually fell, the pilots turned to a last-resort device to adjust the plane's trim. The captain asked the young co-pilot to try to trim the plane manually using a wheel in the centre console to lift the nose and make it easier to recover from the dive. But it was too hard to move the wheel. Both men then tried to pitch the nose up together. The captain, according to the report, said it was not enough.  MCAS RE-ACTIVATES In a possible last-ditch attempt to level the plane, data suggests the pilots turned MCAS-related systems back on. That would also reactivate the electric trim system, and perhaps make it easier for the pilots to force the reluctant nose higher. Reactivating MCAS is contrary to advice issued by Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration after Lion Air. The report did not address that. The pilots managed to lift the nose slightly using the electric thumb switches on their control yokes. But the data readout suggests they flicked those switches only briefly. With its power restored, a final MCAS nose-down command kicked in, eventually pushing the nose down to a 40 degree angle at an airspeed of up to 500 knots, far beyond the plane's operating limits. This is when the jet would inherit the risk of maintaining high take-off thrust, as it dived ""way too fast,"" Langer said. As the 737 MAX plunged, G-forces turned negative, pulling occupants out of their seats and possibly inducing a feeling of weightlessness as the plane hurtled toward the ground. Just six minutes after take off, the plane crashed into a field. ",24.17999999999938,1
698," ANKARA, April 5 (Reuters) - Turkey's main opposition candidate in Sunday's Istanbul local elections said on Friday he remained ahead by 18,742 votes after a recount of invalid votes in 17 of the city's 39 districts. Late on Thursday, election officials expanded the vote recount in Istanbul, broadcaster CNN Turk said, as President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party pushed its appeal against its shock election defeat there. It was unclear how many districts would ultimately see recounts. Republican People's Party (CHP) mayoral candidate Ekrem Imamoglu told Turkey's Fox TV he did not expect the gap between his party and the AKP to change substantially when the recount in the country's largest city was completed. He said 119,652 invalid votes had been recounted, with 2,184 votes added in favour of the AKP and 785 added for the CHP. The AK Party said it would also demand a wider check on votes across the capital Ankara, which, according to initial results, it also narrowly lost in Sunday's nationwide municipal vote. Those losses, if confirmed, would be particularly painful for Erdogan, whose party and its predecessor have dominated the two cities for 25 years. He launched his political career in Istanbul and served as the city's mayor in the 1990s. On Wednesday, Turkey's High Election Board had ordered a full recount in three of Istanbul's 39 districts and a recount of just invalid ballots in 15 districts. However, late on Thursday the board decided there would be a full recount in those 15 districts as well, CNN Turk said. ",24.17999999999938,1

The stock had closed on Thursday at 65.20 francs. The move by the two minority shareholders aims to consolidate control of Alpiq in Swiss hands and eventually take the power supplier private, they said in a statement. EOS until now had 31.4 percent of Alpiq and Primeo Energie had 13.7 percent. The EDF deal will boost a Swiss consortium's combined Alpiq stake to 88 percent. The transaction is subject to approval by competition authorities in Germany. The purchase does not trigger a mandatory offer to remaining shareholders, and any voluntary offer does not carry a minimum price under Swiss takeover rules, the partners said.

703," By Tom Westbrook SYDNEY, April 5 (Reuters) - Social media giant Facebook Inc said on Friday it would strengthen measures to fight fake news in Australia and briefly block foreigners from buying political advertisements in the lead-up to a national election due in a few weeks. The move comes with the company - and its peers around the world - under growing pressure to rid their platforms of misinformation after Russia allegedly used Facebook to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook's move also comes as its market power and social influence faces greater scrutiny, particularly in the wake of the mass shooting at a mosque in New Zealand which was broadcast live on one of the U.S. firm's platforms. Facebook said its new controls on Australian political advertising would take effect as soon as the vote was called, which is expected to happen in the next few days. Foreigners would be forbidden from buying advertising mentioning political parties, slogans and logos, Mia Garlick, Facebook's director of policy for Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement. To fight so-called fake news and misinformation, the U.S. firm would launch a fact-checking service in Australia in partnership with French news agency Agence France-Presse, she added. It would also remove fake accounts and make sensational stories less prominent in users' newsfeeds. Australia's major political parties, which between them are expected to spend millions of dollars buying Facebook ads during the campaign, had no comment on the company's announcement on Friday.  GLOBAL PROBLEM Policing social media content has become a massive global problem, with no template for consistently preventing fake news online or eliminating it. Andrea Carson, a political scientist specialising in media and communications at La Trobe University in Melbourne, said Facebook faced tighter regulation in the future. ""There's a climate for change,"" she said. Fierce internet disinformation battles have gripped countries such as Brazil and Malaysia ahead of elections. Authorities in Indonesia and the European Union, which are due to hold polls, have also warned of the threat of fake news, while in India, Facebook has ramped up efforts to block fake accounts. The market dominance of Facebook and of Alphabet Inc'sGoogle has also drawn the attention of Australia's competition regulator, which is pushing for greater scrutiny of their power and influence, something the firms are resisting.

704," By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, April 5 (Reuters) - Analysts have trimmed their forecasts for the Australian dollar but still expect moderate gains by year-end, while its New Zealand counterpart is also seen ticking higher even as markets price in the risk of interest rate cuts in both countries. The Aussie is expected to remain around current levels of $0.7100 in three months' time, down from $0.7200 expected in the previous poll in March, according to the median prediction of up to 55 analysts in a Reuters poll. The median forecast was for $0.7300 for a year ahead, compared with $0.7400 in March. That is still a brave call given an increasing number of economists are calling for two rate cuts this year. Financial markets are fully pricing in the probability of at least one cut later this year. The Aussie was among the worst performing major currency last year, falling nearly 10 percent to a low of $0.7017. ""The AUD started the year with a return of its trademark volatility. With global market sentiment now looking a touch stretched, we do not think that the international environment will provide a positive backdrop for much longer,"" said Daniel Been, head of forex research at ANZ. ""Growth is slowing and liquidity is tighter. The domestic data are likely to remain below par,"" Been added. Australia's economy slowed sharply in the second half of 2018. That combined with sliding home prices and sluggish wages was enough to convince investors the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will have to cut interest rates this year. The RBA has shown reluctance to cut rates largely because the labour market is going strong, with the jobless rate at an eight-year trough of 4.9 percent. In addition, Australia's exporters are enjoying boom times with the country's trade surplus in February touching record highs. The RBA's conundrum could explain the wide range of forecasts for the Aussie on a 12-month view - from as low as $0.6500 to as high as $0.81 - highlighting the challenge of predicting currency moves. The median forecasts were also kind to the kiwi, putting it at $0.6800 in three months and six months, and $0.7000 on a one-year view, all unchanged from the previous poll. The currency was at $0.6756 on Friday, having slipped in the past month as investors also narrowed the odds on a cut in New Zealand rates. Overnight indexed swaps, which track expectations for official rates, have dropped to 1.46 percent for a year ahead, well under the current 1.75 percent cash rate. Yields on two-year bonds had broken down to 1.50 percent, a long way from the November top of 2.02 percent. ""The NZD is showing surprising resilience,"" ANZ Been's said predicting the kiwi at $0.6300 on a 12-month horizon. ""While it is no longer trading above $0.70, it has substantially outperformed its peers. We do not see this as sustainable."" ",24.17999999999938,1
705," Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense. While I'm not anticipating a big wave of dividend cuts like we saw in 2008 and 2009, it's always best to be on your toes in any market environment (even one like this, where there are far more positives in play than negatives). Because the truth is, a dividend cut can strike anywhere at any time. And the punishment is usually severe. Fortunately, there are four tell-tale warning signs that can help you steer clear: 1) Distributions that Outweigh Earnings. A company can't pay out more than it takes in -- at least not for long. Regular readers have probably heard me talk about payout ratios. This simple calculation measures dividend payments as a percentage of profits. For example, Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) is handing out $5.44 in yearly dividends, supported by $7.29 in annual earnings. That's a payout ratio of 74% ($5.44/$7.29). Inverse these two figures, and you get a coverage ratio of 134% ($7.29/$5.44), meaning the company rakes in $1.34 of net income for every $1.00 it pays out. It's two different ways of expressing the same thing. The sweet spot for most companies is a payout ratio of around 40% to 60%. Too low, and you probably aren't getting a good yield. Too high, and the payout might be on thin ice (especially i f earnings slide). Right in the middle leaves wiggle room for downturns -- as well as future hikes. But that's just a loose rule of thumb. Keep in mind, some industries commonly pay out more. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs) must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to maintain their federal tax-exempt status. Generally, though, be leery of companies with payout ratios near (or above) 100%. They might be able to maintain payments for a while using retained earnings or even debt. But the longer the business stays in a slump, the more likely it will have to eventually reset payouts at a lower level. It's safer to look for comfortable margins of safety, where payments can be maintained even in down years when profits decline. 2) Inadequate Cash Flows. The earnings presented under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are useful but don't always tell the whole picture. In some cases, they can be downright misleading -- either understating or overstating profits. A company tha t report s $1.00 per share in quarterly earnings doesn't necessarily take in $1.00 in operating cash flows after all the bills are paid. It might have pocketed $1.20 that period, or $0.80. That's because there are numerous one-time events that can be added to or subtracted from the bottom-line, even when no money changes hands. They include non-cash items such as amortization, depreciation and stock options compensation. GAAP earnings are also subject to manipulation, but that's a topic for another day. I often use supplemental metrics such as funds from operations (FFO) and distributable cash flow ( DCF ), which are reconciled with earnings by adding back non-cash charges. I think they provide a truer picture of a firm's dividend-paying capacity. REITs and MLPs, for example, incur hefty depreciation and thus generate more cash than net income. But some companies produce less cash than net income -- and are thus less capable of meeting dividends than would first appear. Imagine a business that has been reporting quarterly earnings of $2.00 per share and paying ou t dividends of $1.00. The financial sites will report a seemingly safe payout ratio of 50%. But what if the company only generates $0.90 in cash flow. You might have a problem. How could that happen? Easy. A manufacturer might send a large merchandise order to a retail customer and book it as a sale, but then extend generous credit terms and not collect the revenue until a future period. It's also common for companies to sell off assets and record a gain from the proceeds. It's a perfectly legitimate transaction. But you can't count on this money to sustain future dividends. It's a one-time event. What happens next quarter when there isn't a sale? With all this in mind, take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the cash flow statement, which strips out the impact of one-time gains and losses and reflects the true amount of cash flowing in and out of the business. Don't forget to subtract capital expenditures on property, plants and equipment from operating cash flows to get free cash flow ( FCF ). This is the pool of cash that is used to pay dividends, repurchase shares, or make acquisitions. If a company has weak (or negative) free cash flows, then you must ask yourself where the money is coming from to continue supporting the dividend. 3) Excessive Leverage. When used properly, debt can be a powerful tool. If a business is generating returns on invested capital (RoIC) of 15%, it makes financial sense to borrow money cheaply at 5% to expand and create shareholder value. But leverage can be a double-edged sword. Problems that might not be visible on the income statement lurk on the balance sheet. Too much debt can be dangerous. How much is too much? Unfortunately, there is no specific answer. Financing needs, capital requirements, and other factors vary from industry to industry. One simple evaluation tool is debt-to-EBITDA. A ratio of 4.0 means it would take four years for a company to repay loans using current annualized cash flows. Debt-to-equity is also useful. But what's reasonable for one company might be high for another. You can't compare an automaker, for example, with a bank. Credit ratings can give you a good idea regarding a company's ability to service its debt. A ratings downgrade indicates that there has been a deterioration in the outlook. Keep in mind that while debt levels are important, so too are maturity dates. I pay close attention to the current ratio (current assets/current liabilities), a short-term liquidity gauge. If a company has $10 million in cash, accounts receivable and other assets against $5 million in notes payable and other current liabilities, then it has a ratio of 2 -- meaning $2 on hand to pay every $1 owed over the next 12 months. That's comfortable. But if those figures are reversed and there is only $0.50 to pay every $1 owed, then you might be looking at a company in financial distress. Lenders keep a close eye on asset coverage ratios -- and for good reason. The point is, too much debt can be a heavy burden, particularly in a rising rate environment when borrowing costs rise. While dividend payments are completely voluntary, loan payments are decidedly not. So if a company is on the ropes, these elective payments are likely to get the ax. And if a company's credit line is maxed out, it often raises funding by issuing new shares, which can also put downward pressure on a stock. 4) The Business is in Terminal Decline. They say that if a business isn't growing, then it's dying. That's seldom true. Just about every company on the planet goes through the occasional slump -- even profit powerhouses like Apple (Nasdaq: APPL ). Oil prices are notoriously cyclical, but that hasn't stopped ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM ) from raising dividends for 37 straight years. So temporary downturns don't automatically trigger dividend cuts. Great businesses can hunker down and usually have a reserve stockpile of cash for a rainy day. But I get concerned when there is a development or trend that could impair a firm's cash flows for years to come. Or potentially worse, a disruptive threat to an entire industry. Embattled companies can fight back by launching innovative products, tapping into new markets or finding ways to reinvent themselves. But even if these initiatives work, they are often costly and take time. In the meantime, dividends must often be sacrificed to preserve cash and shore up the balance sheet. This might well be the case with GameStop (NYSE: GME ). The struggling video game retailer is losing the battle against digital downloads in much the same way that internet video streaming doomed physical movie rental chain Blockbuster. The chain has shuttered 150 locations, and the incoming new CEO has promised a complete overhaul. Can it work? Possibly. But in the meantime, I have my doubts about the firm's outsized 14% dividend yield. Don't Be Blindsided
Dividend cuts rarely come out of left field. They are often preceded by a falling share price, which reflects dimmer cash flow prospects and other market concerns. But there are also a lot of false alarms, where shares tumble (and yields spike), yet the company is able to successfully navigate the downturn and maintain payments. These often turn out to be big winners. The biggest challenge is differentiating one from the other. Dividend cuts aren't a death sentence for a stock. A company can only pay out a portion of what it earns. If the playing field changes and earnings fall, then distributions must be set at a lower level. And if conditions improve, they can be raised as quickly as they were lowered. Nevertheless, we don't want to step on these landmines. Monitoring debt levels, payout ratios, cash flow generation, and business/industry fundamentals can help put you on the right path. ",24.17999999999938,1
706," By Milton Castillo and Daina Beth Solomon SANTA MARIA CHIQUIMULA, Guatemala, April 5 (Reuters) - After a U.S.-funded program gave Guatemalan farmer Rigoberto Leon and his neighbors tools to plant new crops like tomatoes and chile peppers, many of them stayed to live off their drought-prone lands even as droves of villagers left for the United States. More programs like the climate change adaptation scheme backed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) that helped Leon are in jeopardy after U.S. President Donald Trump said he will end Washington's aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. He has accused the Central American countries of failing to halt an influx of migrants to the United States. ""Here, there's no money to invest in materials, in what's needed,"" he said. ""If there were more opportunities for work here, there would be no need to go to the United States."" For decades, hundreds of programs throughout Central America have worked to slow the steady outflow of men - and increasingly, children and entire families - through efforts such as assisting farmers, educating teens, improving police and strengthening governance. While these programs have not stopped the overall rise of migration, proponents of international aid say the situation would be worse without them and that the United States should invest more, not less. U.S. assistance expanded under former President Barack Obama, whose administration sought to tackle root causes of immigration. In his last full fiscal year in office, funds appropriated for Central America hit a high of $754 million. That aid has steadily decreased under Trump, however, to $700 million the first year and to $627 million in 2018. Leon, who grows hundreds of pine tree seedlings in a greenhouse equipped with a sprinkler-based irrigation system, both donated by USAID, said the number of families he knew living off the dry hillside more than doubled to 40 as a result of the program, which ran from 2014 to 2017. Local project organizers say they still receive bare-bones U.S. funding to organize training, but are lobbying for more in order to buy storage tanks and tubing to bring water from a nearby river. The Mayan people suffer some of the highest poverty rates in Latin America. Guatemala's paltry tax take and low public investment have contributed to worsening social indicators. Sebastian Charchalac, an agricultural engineer who helped lead the climate change program, lamented that its funding evaporated after Trump took office, saying it could have been extended to additional locations. ""The results are still very good, because they rooted people to their communities,"" he said. While data is not clear on which projects have been affected by the change in government, the Trump administration has signaled a desire to shift funding away from economic aid and climate change-oriented programs, in favor of security and policing. USAID did not respond to a question about why funding was reduced for the Santa Maria program. Instead, it said it was evaluating the impact of Trump's directive to end fiscal year 2017 foreign assistance funding. Approximately $450 million in 2018 funds would be affected, they said. It is also unclear how much funding Trump can cut off without the support of Congress. Rachael Shenyo, a former USAID coordinator in Guatemala who now runs climate change programs funded by non-profit groups and the private sector, said further reductions in U.S. assistance would create an opportunity for China. Since 2017, El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic have all forged closer ties with Beijing, Washington's strategic rival. ""China has been increasing its presence more or less across Latin America. You're going to see a lot more investment,"" Shenyo said.  SELF-SUFFICIENCY Critics of foreign aid say it is not always effective, or helps only small numbers of people, while sometimes acting as a political tool and forcing an underdeveloped country to become dependent on a stronger one. In El Salvador, where migration has been shrinking along with the homicide rate, President-Elect Nayib Bukele said he welcomes funding, but that he wants the country to ultimately stop relying on outside help. ""We Salvadorans should be self-sufficient,"" he told reporters this week. ""It's somewhat a sense of low self-esteem to think that we can't get ahead without humanitarian aid."" U.S. help in El Salvador includes training police and developing strategy. Ever Manzano, the country's police spokesman, said he did not think Trump's vow to cut aid would materialize. ""They have a lot of interest and have had a big presence, substantial investment, and excellent relations with the police force,"" he said. U.S. Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said ending aid would make it harder for Trump to crack down on gangs and crime. During a visit last week to El Salvador, he visited a program that teaches software coding to teens to steer them from crime, and an FBI-backed anti-gang project. ""We're cutting off our nose to spite our face. The very things (Trump's) complaining about, will make it tougher for us to do,"" said Engel. ",24.17999999999938,1

The Tokyo District Court said it had approved the request by prosecutors to detain Ghosn until April 14.

715," By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth likely rebounded from a 17-month low in March as milder weather boosted activity in sectors like construction, which could further allay fears of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter. Worsening worker shortages and lingering effects of tighter financial market conditions at the turn of the year, however, suggest the job gains probably remained below 2018's brisk pace. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 180,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Investors will also be watching to see if February's paltry 20,000 job count, the smallest since September 2017, is revised higher. ""A number that is close to consensus and with an upward revision to February will give you some degree of comfort that while the economy is slowing, it isn't declining rapidly,"" said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America in Baltimore. The economy has shifted into lower gear as stimulus from the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package as well as increased government spending fades. A trade war between Washington and Beijing, and slowing global growth have also taken a toll on the economy, which in July will celebrate 10 years of expansion, the longest on record. Growth forecasts for the first quarter are between a 1.4 percent and 2.1 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter, stepping down from the July-September quarter's brisk 3.4 percent pace. Fears of an abrupt economic slowdown could also be assuaged by strengthening wage growth and a low unemployment rate. Average hourly earnings are expected to have increased 0.3 percent in March after jumping 0.4 percent in February. That would keep the annual increase in wages at 3.4 percent, the biggest gain since April 2009. Strong wage growth could boost confidence that consumer spending would accelerate and support the economy, after consumption stalled in January.  WORKERS ARE SCARCE The scarcity of workers is driving up wages. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.8 percent in March, close to the 3.7 percent that Federal Reserve officials project it will be by the end of the year. Though job gains have moderated from an average of about 223,000 in 2018, they remain above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Economists say a strong employment report in March would suggest that financial market expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates this year were premature. The rate cut expectations gained traction when the U.S. Treasury yield curve briefly inverted in late March, reviving recession fears. The U.S. central bank last month suspended its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy, dropping projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018. ""If the recent weakness is only a soft patch and not quicksand, the Fed may surprise markets and decide to sharpen its monetary tools later this year, with a rate hike just in time for the holidays,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&P Global Ratings in New York. There are roughly 7.58 million open jobs in the economy. This is despite the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, having risen to the highest in more than five years at 63.2 percent. ""Up until now we have had people rejoining the labor force, which allowed businesses to hire people, especially at the unskilled and semi-skilled level,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""There are signs that well could be running dry."" Economists expect job growth to average about 150,000 this year. Employment at construction sites is expected to have rebounded after falling by 31,000 jobs in February, the biggest drop since December 2013. Leisure and hospitality sector payrolls are forecast to have accelerated after stalling. The manufacturing sector is expected to mark 20 straight months of job gains in March, the longest streak since the mid-1980s. But the outlook for the sector is less upbeat as motor vehicle manufacturers have announced thousands of job cuts to deal with slowing sales that have led to an inventory bloat. ",24.17999999999938,1

717,"Economic data released through the Asian session was on the lighter side this morning. Household spending figures out of Japan were the only stats to consider in the early part of the day. Household spending slid by 2% in February, month-on-month, reversing a 0.7% rise in January. Year-on-year, spending rose by 1.7%, coming up short of a forecasted 1.9% increase. According to figures released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications , Weighing on overall household spending, year-on-year, were Supporting household spending: One factor that weighed on overall household spending, year-on-year, was a 0.8% fall in disposable incomes. The Japanese Yen moved from¥111.648 to ¥111.644 against the U.S Dollar upon release of the figures. At the time of writing,  the Japanese Yen was down by 0.05% to ¥111.72 against the U.S Dollar. At the time of writing, the Aussie Dollar was up 0.15% to $0.7123, while the Kiwi Dollar was flat at $0.6754 for the session. Positive updates from China's Premier Xi and U.S President Trump continued to support risk appetite through the early part of the day. Both China and HK markets closed are for the day. In the equity markets, the Nikkei was on the rise, gaining 0.32%, while the ASX200 looked set for another day in the red. At the time of writing, the ASX200 was down by 0.78%. It's another relatively quiet day on the economic calendar . Germany's February industrial production figures are due out ahead of the European open. Following a 4 th consecutive fall in factory orders in February and the continued contraction in Germany's manufacturing sector, anything positive would be a surprise. In the wake of the ECB monetary policy meeting minutes from Thursday, dire numbers could raise the prospects of a near-term move by the ECB. While we can expect the EUR to respond to the numbers, sentiment towards the U.S - China trade talks and Brexit will also be a factor. Later in the day, nonfarm payroll and wage growth figures due out of the U.S will also influence market risk appetite. At the time of writing, the EUR was up 0.03% at $1.1224. Economic data due out of the UK is limited to March house price figures that will have a muted impact on the Pound. Following Wednesday's parliamentary vote in support of the Cooper Bill, the focus has turned to the House of Lords. With the debate over the draft legislation having kicked off on Thursday, a vote could be imminent and there could be a surprise. It's highly unlikely that the draft legislation will get passed without changes, which will then see MPs grapple to push through a bill that previously had passed by just one vote. Chatter from the EU will also need to be monitored. Through Thursday, there wasn't overwhelming support for a lengthy extension unless there was a justifiable reason to do so. A 2 nd Referendum would certainly be something that EU member states would support… At the time of writing, the Pound was up 0.06% to $1.3085. It's a big day for the Greenback. Nonfarm payroll and wage growth figures will be the key driver later today. Following February's particularly dire NFP numbers, the markets will be looking for a bounce back. Recent weekly jobless claims figures support a rebound, though will it be enough. The markets will need to see 185K plus to really be convinced… Wage growth will likely have less of an influence this time around, following the FED's decision to hit pause on rate hikes. Outside of the numbers, market risk sentiment will provide direction for the Dollar ahead of the numbers. At the time of writing, the Dollar Spot Index was down by 0.02% to 97.284. Canada's labor market figures are due out later in the day. We can expect the Loonie to be particularly sensitive to the stats. While forecasts are for the unemployment rate to hold steady at 5.8%, it will be the employment change numbers that count… Outside of the stats, expect market risk appetite to overshadow the stats later in the day. The Loonie was flat at C$1.3359, against the U.S Dollar, at the time of writing. This article was originally posted on FX Empire",-13.799999999999272,0

International benchmark Brent futures LCOc1 dropped 26cents, or 0.4 percent, to $69.14 a barrel by 0229 GMT, havingtouched $70.03 in the previous session, the highest since Nov.12.

Still, Brent is heading for a second week of gains, whileWTI is on track for a fifth consecutive weekly rise. Oil prices have gained this year after the Organization ofthe Petroleum Exporting Countries and producer allies such asRussia, known as OPEC+, agreed to cut output by 1.2 millionbarrels per day (bpd) to prevent a supply overhang from growing. Prices are now finely balanced, said Abhishek Kumar, seniorenergy analyst at Interfax Energy in London ""The OPEC+ group has so far maintained a high compliancewith their output-cut deal, which together with positiveeconomic data from the U.S. and China, are supporting oilprices,"" Kumar said.

Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and year-end call for fiscal 2018. This past year was one of significant growth and accomplishment for the Duluth business. Our goal this year were to achieve strong revenue growth, strengthen our omnichannel presence, implement key infrastructure improvements and reach more customers than we ever have before. We achieved these objectives and some highlights for the year include revenue growth of almost $100 million over 2017; a 50% expansion of our store base, ending with the year with 46 stores, including three locations in Texas, one of our top three states; market share growth in both new and established store market; the power of the omnichannel model continues to prove out as evidenced by established store markets consistently achieving direct growth rates at more than doubled the non-store market rates; continued double-digit growth in our active customer base along with an improvement in key metrics such as the percent of customer shopping across categories and average annual spend per customer; implementation of a large-scale infrastructure improvements, including a new order management system, inventory planning system and e-commerce platform, and upgrade to our distribution center in Belleville, Wisconsin. And finally, the launch of customer-facing omni programs such as Buy-Online-Pickup-In-Store or BOPIS, ship-from-store and e-gift cards. While executing all these important initiatives puts us in a stronger competitive position for the future, our fourth quarter, which is the lion's share of our revenues and profitability, fell short of our expectations. We began the holiday shopping season with a strong showing on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and we were on track to deliver higher sales results through the first week of December. As we got closer to Christmas and through January, we experienced a slowdown in customer response, which we attribute to some factors that were in our control and others that were not. On a macro level, we were not immune to the overall slowdown in consumer spending and we felt the impact of lower traffic across all of our channels. Internally, we encountered some challenges with systems implementation and late deliveries of product. As a result we had inventory that with misaligned to the timing of sales and not distributed optimally throughout the network. This affected store productivity and added extra cost throughout the system, and some of our high-demand product didn't hit the market in time to reach the full benefit of the holiday season. For example, we were out of stock in some of our highest volume sizes of our women's Plus Size program during this critical time of the year. We also took more back orders than we had planned due to later deliveries of the product and incurred more labor in the distribution centers and in the stores to process the flow of goods, which added considerable expense for the quarter. It is important to note that despite these issues we delivered a 15% increase in revenues over last year. Critical to the business, our new e-commerce platform had the stability to handle peak volumes and we saw significant improvement in site speed. Total website visits in the fourth quarter increased 11% year-over-year with continued growth in new visitors. Most importantly, we recognize that as our model successfully shifts from direct to omnichannel, retail stores continue to influence customer engagements and revenues and across the entire ecosystem. We know that when we open a store, that store presence quickly increases market penetration and longer term it's a catalyst for higher growth rate in direct. With total market growth being key to our success, top priority efforts are under way to drive awareness of and traffic to the stores. This is especially important as we expand to more new markets. This requires even more focused on the specific drivers of retail stores. For example, the importance of new high volume products in our assortments each season. Unlike the direct business that drives on core stable, delivering fresh assortments to our retail stores, drives overall sales, attracts new customers to the brand, and boots traffic overall. We increased our new product introduction this past year, but several of our program fell short to our sales expectations, particularly in men's accessories and outerwear. We know that we can do better and we are planning for more new styles, sizes and color options to create a pipeline of fresh impactful product year-around. We will double the number of SKUs in our women's plus size category and we will also continue to build out the rest of our women's business, Alaskan Hardgear and men's base layers, which are significant and proven drivers of growth. Overall, we are planning for a 40% increase in new product that will be ready for the fall and peak season. In addition to evolving the assortment to meet the expectations of our omnichannel customers, we are focused on improving our ability to attract new and retain existing customers through targeted marketing and a more personalized web and store experience. This past season we did not yet have all of the elements of customer-facing marketing efforts in place and we were still -- are still working on these initiatives through the first quarter. For example, we know that the influence of women customers on omnichannel sales is important and growing, yet we were underpenetrated in marketing efforts that spoke specifically and directly to her. We will leverage the momentum in this part of our business by investing in additional advertising, increasing visibility within retail stores and doubling and improving our marketing mix. Our men's business grew 19% year-over-year with Alaskan Hardgear being one of the fastest growing segments and achieving a three-year CAGR of 95%. We have a lot of opportunity to grow this popular sub-brand by expanding its retail footprint in appropriate store markets and by leveraging its brand appeal beyond outerwear with year-around apparel. In a few minutes I will share our plans for this year. But first I'll turn the call over to Dave to discuss the details of our financial results and our guidance for 2019. Dave Loretta -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Stephanie, and good afternoon, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we reported net sales of $250.5 million, up 15% compared to $217.8 million last year. This included $7.7 million for an extra 53rd week in 2018 as compared to 2017. Net sales growth was driven by both our retail and direct segments, with retail sales increasing 39% to $86.8 million and direct sales growing 5.4% to $163.8 million. Excluding the 53rd week, direct segment growth was 2.5% to $159 million and retail segment growth was 34% to $83.8 million. For the quarter, shipping revenues were $3.4 million, a decrease of 40% compared to the prior year. In retail, we opened a total of three new stores, adding approximately 40,000 gross square feet to our retail footprint. We ended the year with a total of 46 stores and approximately 716,000 gross square feet. As Stephanie mentioned, our holiday business was on trend heading into December, but we started to see some mixed results two weeks prior to Christmas. Direct sales were healthy through Christmas with the first eight weeks of the quarter growing 7% over last year. This trend reversed at that point with direct sales lagging last year by close to negative 6%. Our store sales productivity was good through early December, but didn't finish the holiday selling season as strong as last year. In January, we were up against a very promotional period last year and direct sales growing over 20% in that period. The addition of clearance goods and flash events this year didn't result in enough business to see online gains in January. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $131.3 million or 52.4% of net sales compared to $116 million or 53.3% of net sales last year. The 90 basis point decrease in gross margin rate was primarily due to an 80 basis point decline in shipping revenues and increased freight cost of our stores. Gross margins on our product sales improved over last year by 40 basis points, but were largely offset by end of year shrink and other cost of goods adjustments, including some adjustments that related to correcting system, inventory balances which were inflated by the cut over to the new order management system earlier in the year. We discovered the inflated inventory during our year-end close, but have determined that the adjustments are immaterial to our full year results. We are completing our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls related to this and expect that that assessment will be completed in time for our 10-K filing. Moving on to expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.7% to $109 million compared to $86.5 million last year. This increase included $300,000 in advertising and marketing expenses, $9.6 million in selling expenses and $4.6 million in general and administrative expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense increased 60 basis points to 40.3% compared to 39.7% last year. As a percentage of net sales, advertising and marketing costs decreased 200 basis points to 14.4% compared to 16.4% in the fourth quarter last year. The 200 basis point decrease was largely due to cost reductions related to catalog circulation and the shift of women's and men's catalogs from late January into February 2019, as well as leverage gained in advertising from a higher mix of retail net sales. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 16% compared to 14.1% last year. The 190 basis point increase was primarily due to higher retail selling costs from additional stores, an increase in shipping expense and an increase in distribution and call center labor. The increase in shipping expenses were primarily due to back orders and higher shipping rates during the peak season. The increase in direct fulfillment expenses were the result of our planned increase in wage rates as well as higher shipments per order due to a greater percentage of back orders. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 70 basis points to 9.9% compared to 9.2% last year, primarily due to higher depreciation from the investments we made in new stores, technology and infrastructure. As we continue to fine-tune the new order management platform, we did experience additional cost to stabilize and maintain high customer service levels, that added an estimated $1.1 million in expenses in the quarter. For the quarter, we reported net income of $20.8 million -- of net income or $0.64 per diluted share compared to net income of $19.5 million or $0.60 per diluted share last year. This includes an update to our effective tax rate from 26% to 26.7% as a result of the greater state tax apportionment. Adjusted for the change in tax rates due to the US tax reform in 2018, our prior year fourth quarter net income was $21.2 million or $0.66 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $35.3 million compared to $32.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. We closed fiscal 2018 with a healthy balance sheet that positions us well for making strategic product, inventory and marketing adjustments to capitalize on our customers' preference for newness. At the end of the year, net working capital was $65 million with $16.5 million outstanding on our $130 million line of credit. Inventories increased 8.5% to $97.2 million compared to $89.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year -- $9.5 million of total inventory related to the additional 15 stores opened during 2018 and partially offset by improvement in turns. Our outlet in clearance inventory showed a minimal increase at the end of 2018. As we progress into the first quarter of 2019, the response so far has been favorable to clearing that inventory and we expect to end the first quarter in a lower clearance position, allowing us to focus more on new products and full price selling. Total capital expenditures were $50.8 million in 2018 compared to $42.8 million last year. As we discussed a year-ago, our 2018 capital expenditure plan reflected a peak investment year that was focused on supporting our growth strategy with new store openings, foundational investments and automation in our distribution center, implementing a new order management and inventory planning system, and replacing our outdated website. Now moving on to the 2019 financial guidance, which is based on 52-weeks. We expect 2019 net sales to be between $645 million and $655 million with the retail channel accounting for up to 45% of total 2019 net sales, and mid single-digit growth in direct. We plan to open 15 new stores in 2019. We expect full year gross profit rate to be flat compared to 2018 with slight improvement in product margins, offset by continued decline in shipping revenues of roughly 30 basis points. The exception to this will be in our first quarter where the sluggish trend in sales, both online and in stores, and heavier clearance activity is expected to negatively impact gross profit rate by 200 basis points to 250 basis points. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to be 70 basis points to 120 basis points over last year, half of which is due to a shift of lease expenses from the interest line item to SG&A, plus an incremental $1 million in lease expenses as a result of the adoption of the new accounting lease standard. Excluding these impacts, the growth in the stores channel will continue to drive SG&A increases, along with higher depreciation expenses related to technology, infrastructure projects placed into service during 2018. As a result, the annualization of higher depreciation related technology support costs and higher fulfillment labor rates will impact the first half of 2019 much more so than the back half. We anticipate these additional expenses will be partially offset by leverage gain in advertising, primarily due to higher retail sales in 2019. The one exception will be in the first quarter where we expect advertising to deleverage up to 20 basis points based on the shift in catalog drop dates into the quarter, as well as investing deeper in women's TV advertising for the spring and summer assortments. We expect 2018 earnings per diluted share to be between $0.74 and $0.80. This assumes a full year weighted average diluted share count of 32.5 million shares and a tax rate of 27%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $60 million and $64 million or a 15% to 23% increase. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million with the majority of spend on new stores and omnichannel growth initiatives. We expect our free cash flow to turn positive in 2019 as we enter the period of steady state capital investments and begin to leverage fixed costs in the business model. In closing, we ended the year with softness in sales trends on top of the heavy investment in foundational systems that impacted profitability growth. However, we have a solid plan for 2019 and are already executing on that plan. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Stephanie. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Dave. Our culture of innovation is not limited to the products that we offer our customers. We did a lot of heavy lifting in 2018 to enhance our omnichannel model and to build a strong platform capable of creating deeper engagement with rapidly evolving customer expectations and technology that is moving faster than ever. While these initiatives created some near-term pressures in our business, we generated strong top line growth and maintained profitability in 2018. Looking forward, our focus will be on optimizing our investments and maximizing the opportunities we see to enrich brand awareness and engagement across all contact points with the customer. We are intensely focused on the parts of the business with greatest momentum and the greatest opportunity for increased market penetration. These areas include the women's business, Alaskan Hardgear and men's base players. We are introducing proportionately more new product innovations in these areas and we have outsized our marketing efforts to drive growth and awareness. We will continue to expand and refine our omnichannel model with the goal of an additional 15 new stores and holistic effort to engage customers across channels, including the roll out of BOPIS. Regarding BOPIS, I can report to you that our trial in seven stores during 2018 exceeded our expectations. 91% of the customers polled indicated that they're likely or very likely to use BOPIS again. We expect to have this slide in all existing stores by the end of this month and we will make it available in all of our new stores as well. As we see it, BOPIS creates multiple opportunities. It gets product to the customer faster than shipping, it encourages purchases in the store at the time of pickup and it ensures that we will have the product on hand when customers make the trip to the store. We will refine the investments that we implemented this past year, including improving the speed of our order management systems and continuing to build on the assortment and inventory planning tool, which will more accurately predict inventory needs by location and ultimately allow us to localize assortments by store and respond to customers' different needs by climate and geography. Hand-in-hand, we will focus on productivity improvements to leverage the variable costs associated with our investments. This includes, increasing our use of pop up distribution centers for peak selling season, increasing the amount of product that is retail ready from our vendors and more accurately projecting on-hand inventory needs throughout the network. And finally, we will begin to utilize insights from our marketing mix study to more fully engage customers across all of our marketing efforts. As our model has become more complex, our ability to understand and act on what is truly driving customer behavior is increasingly important. Through test and learn, we expect to more fully leverage the spend in the future. We have an ambitious yet achievable agenda for 2019. The investments made to date have not been just in brick and mortar and IT systems, but also in talent and training. (Technical Difficulty) stronger and deeper than it's ever been. We remain fully committed to our long-term strategy of building the Duluth Trading brand through an omnichannel experience that we entirely control. We are well positioned to move our business forward and thereby create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we welcome your questions. Operator We will not begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from John Morris with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. John Morris -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Hi, thanks. Hi, Stephani, hi, Dave. Hi, couple of questions on the product category performance. Stephanie, I know you did mention it, you mentioned it very quickly, so I'm wondering if you give us a little bit more color on what you saw in terms of the product category performance, for example, I think I heard you say that outerwear didn't perform as well as you wanted it to. And so maybe that also kind of begs the question, if that's the case and/or volunteer your feeling on how whether or not weather impacted you on the quarter. And just generally on the product category performance, both men and women. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So first, let me start at a slightly higher level on the men's versus women's. Our women's business continues to outpace the overall business in growth and -- the men's business. We picked up another couple of points of penetration in the women's business overall. And we are definitely seeing an increasing momentum in women's even as we go into the first quarter, particularly around some of our newest product launches and our plus-size business, for example, continues to be a very strong part of our business overall. So on the women's side of things, we certainly had a few products that exceeded expectations, a few that were -- fell a little bit shy, but overall in women's, I'd say we had some pretty decent momentum throughout the quarter. The struggles that we had specifically on product really were twofold. There were a couple of large-scale programs that we had that were more weighted toward our men's business in outerwear. They were new launches of products that just didn't meet our expectations overall. We had certain pockets of outerwear that were good, but by and large, our outerwear business fell short. We also saw that the accessories hard goods part of the business didn't meet our expectations, again geared more toward the men's side of things. That said, there was also an exacerbation of product performance, in that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had some later deliveries, some inventory that was misaligned. Specific to that we had some deliveries that were later than we expected due to some port congestion, a little bit later on into the quarter. And that was -- they added to our problems there in that. We had tight deliveries to begin with and then trying to get some of those goods out to the full network, including all of the stores in time for certain peak selling -- peak parts of the selling season was difficult. So we found -- we also found that we had some of our inventory that we didn't get out to our DC network fully and completely in time, again for some of those peak weeks. So we were taking on more burden in our Belleville, Wisconsin distribution center than we had anticipated, which added to cost and slowed down the inventory replenishment to our retail stores. As you may remember Belleville is the one DC that replenishes our retail stores. So when we get clogged up there on the direct side, it tends to impact the whole system. So those were the big things around the product side of things. And what I'd say, John, in terms of the impact of both of those, they are probably both -- both equally weighted in terms of the sales volume impact, but the second thing that I talked about with the inventory misalignment also had expense ramifications as well. John Morris -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst That's a lot of helpful color. I'm wondering, I mean, given that the pace of the slowdown coming so late in the quarter, whether or not you all want to comment on what you're seeing so far top line wise here at the beginning of the first quarter since we're you know pretty well through it, whether or not you're seeing and to what degree you can comment qualitatively on recovery. Dave, I know you gave a fair amount of color on some other below the top line item things, but I'm wondering if you can comment any kind of a recovery that you've seen so far, top line wise. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer On the top line side, John, I'll take that one and then pass it off to Dave for any additional comments. Q1 has been slow for us. We haven't come out of the sluggishness that we saw in Q4. We're not really seeing a trend reversal at this time, particularly on the men's side of the business. That said, our women's customer, particularly with the new product has been responding more quickly and stronger. So our women's trend is actually still quite good, but we did come out of fourth quarter with, you know, because of those issues that I described just a moment ago, with additional end of season clearance inventory, which we took some additional markdowns on in late February and early March to move those goods, we feel good about where we are today on that inventory position and we feel good about, as we keep going deeper into the year, the plans and the new products that we have in place to introduce to the customer, but we really see first quarter sluggish, second quarter perhaps a little bit of recovery, but really it's going to be -- and the inflection point is the latter half of the year for some of the product turnaround as well as some of the marketing efforts that we have in place. The last thing that I would mention to you is, we haven't yet seen an all-out kind of spring whether reversal, if you will, with a lack of rain and obviously not such hot temperatures. So in terms of really gauging some of our warmer weather product, it's still a little too early to tell and call that. John Morris -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Yeah, OK. All the best for spring there. Thank you. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, John. Operator The next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please go ahead. Jonathan Komp -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst Yeah, hi. Thank you. I wanted to just first follow-up about the inventory-related comments and you already characterized more of the operations, factors that you called out. Just curious, Stephanie, kind of when do you think you'll have a good handle on all those factors and (Technical Difficulty) any more color as diagnosed some the operating factors (Technical Difficulty). Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Jon, you broke up a little bit for me. So I'll start with what I did hear about commentary on some of the inventory comments that I made, as well as where we are today and how we see that evolving and improving. Is that a fair -- is that your question? Jonathan Komp -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst (Technical Difficulty) Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Okay. So we really saw some pretty significant impact on inventory misalignment over -- in fourth quarter, obviously because fourth quarter is such an important part of our year and every day is a significant amount of volume. So one or two days of misalignment or missed delivery of an order is very impactful in the fourth quarter, more so of course than any other quarter. That said, the things that we can control, we have found that our deliveries are back to the standard, if you will, in terms of being on-time delivery. We haven't of late experience those same types of inventory delays or delivery delays, I should say, that we experienced in the fourth quarter. In addition, in fourth quarter we were just coming off of the transition to our new expansion of our Belleville distribution center, which primarily affects retail replenishment, that was a slow kind of restart at the end of the third quarter. It stayed impacting us in fourth quarter. So we're past some of those things. The piece that we are still working on from an inventory perspective is we're still fine-tuning the new assortment and inventory planning tool that we put in place in late third quarter and that is the tool that anticipates sales curves and demand needs in stores ahead of the curve. And while we think that is working well, we definitely think there's opportunities to improve that and to optimize that system, looking at things like opportunities for highest volumes SKUs to be in a never out situation and what type of inventory levels would it take to do that and we're working with our vendors to be able to fast track some inventory on some of these higher volume items so that we are in better stock position across the entire system. The other thing that we're looking at is, as we have -- as I mentioned in the remarks, we are finding more and more that our retail business and our retail customer is responding more disproportionately to new and the new seasons good. And so we are looking -- we're going back into our placement of orders on those types of goods and ensuring we have the depth of inventory levels to be able to stay in stock, in that product across, you know, now the 50 stores with our with our Spokane store coming online that we have and making sure that we've got enough inventory to go across the entire system. Jonathan Komp -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a question just some of the (Technical Difficulty) drivers (Technical Difficulty) marketing initiatives later in the year, can you talk about your degree of confidence that those are the business forward and any -- any results that kind of tests related to some of that or any more color that you could share. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So one of the -- one of the kind of confidence proof points that we have today, I've mentioned it a couple of times in terms of the juxtaposition of women's results versus our men's results right now. Women's, we have doubled the amount of newness and the floor right now that we have in men and that business is trending better. The product that we have -- that we have introduced, that is transitional product as well as some of the early reads that we've gotten in women's, and remember that our women's customer will shop a little bit more ahead of the season than our men's buy now, wear now guy is, we've seen some very positive indication on some of the early reads even there in summer goods, if you will. The other piece that we have seen is that in our men's business where we've had small collections of new product, we've gotten actually an early good response but we haven't been in the inventory position to be able to sustain some of these new kind of trending products. The last piece that you asked about confidence as we go forward, I would say that the depth of newness and some of the large-scale programs that we have or introducing a full new category in women's. I'll keep you guys in suspense on that until we get a little bit closer on exactly what that looks like, but that's a, that's an important driver of what we've got go forward. We've doubled the SKUs available in our plus size business which is proving itself out. So I feel really good about where we're going go forward. It's going to take a little bit of time for us to get there because we're not there yet. The other thing that I would just mention is marketing efforts. We have already started some of the test and learn efforts coming off of our first marketing mix indicators that we got in late fourth quarter and we're starting to see indicators of results there. We expect that we'll have the results shortly coming off of fourth quarter and we'll be utilizing that to adjust our marketing investments for third and fourth quarter for the year as well. Jonathan Komp -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst Okay, great. And just last one from me, a bit of a follow-up. But when you look at the margin performance of the business, given the marketing model, mix changes maybe leveraging some of the systems that are now in place, like how far out do you think you are from stabilizing and maybe starting to improve operating margin again? Dave Loretta -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jon, we have talked about the second half of 2019 as a point where we expect some operating margins to start to expand and that is what we are expecting to see. So I'd kind of characterize this as, third quarter, we expect that trend to begin and that's what's reflected in our guidance. Jonathan Komp -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst Okay, great, thanks for all that color. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Jon. Operator The next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please go ahead. Jim Duffy -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Thank you. Good afternoon. Couple of questions from me. First, just on trends during December, the check showed a more promotional stance on a year-to-year basis, that's consistent with your comments on trends across the quarter. Did you find that consumers just weren't responding to promotions like they have in the past? Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, I think it was part was partially that, Jim. It was also that we were up against some pretty deep flash sales. And while we stayed very promotional and increased some of our global, you know, take X percent of your orders promotions in the month of January, we still just didn't see quite the response that we expected. We are attributing some of that -- quite frankly, to some of the things that I've already talked about with having impactful new large-scale programs that some of them that we had and the customer just didn't react to them at full price or at markdown, as well as just some overall slowdown because we did see that it was enterprisewide, if you will, that sluggishness. Jim Duffy -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Okay. And Stephanie, maybe you just answered my next question. But I'm curious trends across the quarter, the linearity of the quarter was fairly consistent between the direct and the retail business. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. And I would say that they've also been fairly consistent in terms of what we've seen in prior quarters. And what I mean specifically, Jim, about that is that we do consistently see, for example, that we sell more of a proportion of our sales at full price in retail stores then in direct. Direct is a more promotional segment or channel for us, primarily driven with emails, as you would imagine, and we saw that consistently, but it was all kind of -- there was an umbrella of sluggishness across all aspects. Jim Duffy -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Okay, helpful. Thanks. And then you have referenced a couple of times the need for more newness in the stores. What are you seeing with respect to store traffic trends. Is that something you can comment on, any help that would be... Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, sure. I would say -- there are two things I can say about that. Number one is, when we talk about the quarter that we just came off of and even the continuation into first quarter, we have seen traffic sluggishness across the board. So that's web traffic sluggishness as well as store traffic. In regard to the newness and what we see with that, there are two things. Number one is, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we know when we look at the proportion of sales that are driven by core basics versus brand new product versus seasonal new product, and when I mentioned, seasonal new that something like a flannel shirt that might be a repeat of prior year, but it goes away in the spring and summer then comes back again in the fall, that seasonal new and the brand new product is the higher driver of our retail revenues than it is in direct. And we see that when we deliver a new store set, when we deliver a new catalog, for example, or a new television ad that is featuring either that seasonal product or brand new product, we see store traffic increase more quickly and staff and -- at a faster stronger or pace, if you will, than even the web traffic. Jim Duffy -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Okay. So it seems like the retail stores are showing some different characteristics than the online, which is to be expected, I suppose. Merchandise assortments, you're still getting figured out. I'm curious, you're adding retail stores, putting new systems in place. Does it make sense to take some time to get your feet underneath you before and tap the brakes on opening stores. Is that something that's been discussed? Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer As we're looking at the opening of the stores and the 15 store plan that we have again this year, the primary filters, if you will, that we're using are, you know, the stores that we are opening, even though we're coming off of a sluggish quarter, the stores that we're opening are still achieving or exceeding our model goals. All of the things that we've talked about a number of times with sales per square foot goals as well as four-wall EBITDA projections, projection of payback on the initial investment and we are seeing continued strength in the omni model, the direct side of the business in our more established longer store market. So there is all the really positive indications around the omnichannel model and the growth there. That said, the other filters, if you will, that we use and we want to make sure that we always have in place, are obviously the capital in place. The second thing would be the available real estate that is right for us, not just they are because it's available and the ability to manage staff and create a customer experience that we expect from our stores. So if those things are all in place, we expect to keep moving forward with our store expansion. And as far as the systems piece of things, we are obviously still dealing with the refinement of the system and what we sometimes call the tail that flows and after the implementation and we're working on those things, but the very large scale implementations are behind us at this point and we're really focusing on refining the use of those systems this year as opposed to kind of turning over again. Jim Duffy -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Very good, thank you for that. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator The next question comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair. Please go ahead. Dylan Carden -- William Blair -- Analyst Yeah, hi. Thank you very much. Curious to trying to understand the wider spread between store productivity and direct business and how direct was able to kind of pull out of this quarter with some positive momentum which you expect to continue this year. I guess how much of the implementation of new order management systems do you attribute to the decline in the retail channel from a productivity standpoint. And then go forward, any update you can give vis-a-vis kind of the interaction of the two channels, one year, two years in, you know, customer retention of the 50% new customers, how many you're seeing in that second year that come back to the store, any sort of second-year trend in these newer stores you've now had opened from 2017, any kind of data points in and around sort of the aging of the fleet, so to speak, would be helpful. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Dylan, that with a lot of questions. So I'm going to try to them off one at a time and please let me know if I forget about one, OK? So just starting with sales productivity and the retail versus direct and the results that we saw and how OMS and systems might have impacted that, I would say that the impact of the systems implementation overall was threefold. Specific to your question about was there an impact to the trend line, if you will, of retail, we definitely had some impact. It's hard to quantify on the lack of inventory or lack of timely inventory in the stores in the peak season I've mentioned before with the changeover of both of our DC as well as the new assortment and inventory planning system that we implemented at the end of third quarter. That definitely had an impact on our stores where people were coming in during the peak season and we didn't have full inventory position, particularly in some of our higher volume items. One of the benefits that we have go forward for that will be the BOPIS roll-out to all of our stores. But remember in the fourth quarter that was only in seven stores, so it was really not impactful at all in terms of the grand scheme of things. The second impact that the systems implementations had were obviously with expenses and that's not necessarily a retail trend line issue, but it was certainly very real impact to our bottom line for fourth quarter and for the year. And we've talked I know about some of that in our prepared remarks. The third piece that systems implementation had in terms of an impact was quite frankly there were a lot of our team members that were working through the implementation of those systems as well as the refinement and making sure that we were fixing the bugs as we came through third and fourth quarter this year. And there were some energy spent on those systems implementations and refinement that we have back now to be able to be focused on retail replenishment and inventory levels and making sure we have newness and assortment and all that sort of thing. So I do think that we lost some kind of mindshare time, if you will, on some of the retail specific business drivers. The last thing that I would mention is, one of the things that I tried to communicate and I think with some of the other questions is, becoming a little bit clear is, we are now at the point where almost 40% of our business last year was done in the retail channel and we know that retail customers go back and they shop across channels. So they may come into retail stores for the new seasonal product or the brand new product, but oftentimes they will often go back and order online for their core basics or a new color or something that they just bought. So while 40% or so the transactions are done at retail, a far greater amount of the overall sales are being influenced and impacted by our presence in retail. And we have an opportunity to get a little bit sharper, a little bit smarter about the specific demands of the retail channel that drive customer decisions like this newness we've been talking about a lot and how we go forward and strengthen that. The other part of your question I believe was how -- what are like kind of the customer metrics around retail stores. Dylan Carden -- William Blair -- Analyst Yes, you've provided before some handy metrics around sort of in the second year you see direct sales in these new markets to X growth relative to the plea, that's kind of where I was going within? Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So let me talk first about just some quick kind of view of the customer. Our retail customers are, they shop more often with us, there's a higher retention rate of retail customers. They spend more on an annualized basis, particularly driven by the visits that occur more often. They also are more likely to buy across categories, across genders and to go back and forth between the channels, kind of what I just explained a couple of minutes ago with back to quarter in basics online. In terms of the overall business and what happens in the market, we are still seeing that, that same dynamics that we've talked about for a little while now which is, we enter a store -- a market with a store, we instantly see that market penetration grow substantially with the store volume that we've just added to the market. In the first year, we do see direct growth rates contract to a little bit lower than what the non-store or average market direct growth rates are. As we enter into the second year of that store being in the market, we are still seeing, and even in the slower fourth quarter, we are still seeing direct growth rates in established store markets being double or more so than growth rates in non-store markets. So we're absolutely still seeing that retail has a positive impact on direct growth ultimately. We do see that in the second year of a store being in a market, we do see some contraction in four wall store sales, but that's happening, you know, we've got a few months where the direct sales are not reignited to a really fast pace and the store sales are kind of hitting up again the grand opening in their 14th, 15th month before the direct starts refiring to the level where the market is growing again. And so, there is that period of a lull, if you will, in that second year of a retail store, but we've consistently seen between direct growth and the retail store being present significant market penetration increase and absolutely an improvement in direct growth rate. Dylan Carden -- William Blair -- Analyst Great. Thank you very much. Can I sneak one last one to hear about on profitability? I'm just curious, on the gross margin guidance you know I think it was kind of similar last year and ultimately (Technical Difficulty) I guess sort of confidence level that you're going to go to offset or is it that shipping level -- shipping threshold should stay more consistent this year given kind of where they are trended? And then also on marketing whether or not kind of your plans for the year and what you saw in the fourth quarter gives you some hesitation on leveraging that line item longer term more aggressively? Thanks. Dave Loretta -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Dylan, on the gross margin expectation, we do expect that the shipping revenue decline will continue and that was call out in the comments around 30 basis points of impact to gross margin as a result of that. We do expect that product margin will largely offset that and that will play out through the course of the year, similar to last year with the first quarter being a bigger decline in the gross margin rate and then the other periods of the quarter of the year being positive. But in terms of advertising, we also see that the new element that we've got going into 2019 is some learnings from our marketing mix modeling study that we'll apply to our spend already this first part of the year and probably more so in the back part of the year because we'll have the learnings after this past back half of the year analysis available to us. So we're confident that the advertising leverage will be there, but it'll be more targeted and more focused on the elements that drive the activities that we're looking for. So that's in what's available to us going forward. Dylan Carden -- William Blair -- Analyst Great, thank you very much. Stephanie L. Pugliese -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Dylan.

720," By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, April 5 (Reuters) - Asian share markets consolidated their weekly gains on Friday as Sino-U.S. talks produced a lot of headlines but no conclusions, while caution ahead of U.S. payrolls and a holiday in China dampened volatility. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.1 percent but was only just off its highest since the end of August. The index was still up 1.8 percent for the week and 13 percent for the year so far. ""Share markets have run hard and fast from their December lows and are vulnerable to a short-term pullback,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital. ""But valuations are okay, global growth is expected to improve into the second half of the year, monetary and fiscal policy has become more supportive of markets and the trade war threat is receding."" Xinhua reported Chinese President Xi Jinping had said progress was being made and called for an early conclusion of negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday a deal could be announced in about four weeks, but warned it would be difficult to let China trade with the United States if remaining issues were not resolved. Investors are also waiting on the U.S. payrolls report, which is forecast to bounce back by 180,000 in March, following February's distorted 20,000 rise. One focus will be hourly earnings, which climbed to 3.4 percent in February, the fastest pace since April 2009. Hopes for a solid number were boosted by data on jobless claims which fell to a 49-year low last week, pointing to sustained labour market strength. The Dow ended Thursday up 0.64 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.21 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 0.05 percent. The S&P 500 reached its highest level since Oct. 9 and is only 1.75 percent below its all-time closing high.  YEN EASING In currencies, the progress on trade was enough to keep the safe-haven yen under pressure and lift the dollar to its highest in three weeks at 111.79. The next chart stops were 111.89 and the March peak around 112.12. Against a basket of currencies the dollar had bounced back to 97.287, from Wednesday's low of 96.962. Reuters reported Saudi Arabia is threatening to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if Washington passes a bill exposing OPEC members to U.S. antitrust lawsuits, three sources familiar with Saudi energy policy said. The euro was flat at $1.1223 having dipped overnight in the wake of poor German data. Industrial orders there fell by the most in more than two years in February as foreign demand slumped, another sign that Europe's largest economy had a weak start to the year. Sterling was stalled at $1.3077 as markets awaited some clarity on where Brexit was heading. Pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain's upper house of parliament tried on Thursday to thwart the approval of a new law that would force Prime Minister Theresa May to seek a delay to prevent a disorderly EU exit on April 12 without a deal. A source close to negotiations on the timetable for the bill said they expected it to be finalised on Monday. In commodity markets, spot gold dipped to $1,291.61 per ounce but held above a near 10-week low hit overnight. Brent oil had briefly touched $70 a barrel for the first time since November on Thursday as expectations of tight global supply outweighed pressure from rising U.S. production. [O/R} Brent crude futures were off 23 cents at $69.17, while U.S. crude eased 3 cents to $62.07 a barrel.  Asia stock markets Asia-Pacific valuations ",-13.799999999999272,0
721," By Meng Meng and Jessica Jaganathan SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, April 5 (Reuters) - Australia's Woodside Petroleum WPL.AX has signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to China'sENN Group for 10 years from 2025, both companies said on Friday. Woodside, Australia's biggest listed oil and gas explorer, said in a statement the volume covered by the HOA is 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), to be sourced from Woodside's portfolio of gas supply. Signed at the LNG 2019 conference in Shanghai, the HOA follows a cooperation agreement sealed last October. ""This HOA demonstrates market support for Woodside's proposals to expand the Pluto LNG facility and develop the Scarborough offshore gas resource as part of our vision for the Burrup Hub in Western Australia,"" Woodside's chief executive Peter Coleman said in the statement. Woodside added that the HOA remains conditional upon the negotiation and execution of a fully termed sales and purchase agreement, as well as obtaining all necessary approvals and a final investment decision on Scarborough, a project off northwestern Australia. In November, last year, Woodside entered a long-term gas sale and purchase agreement with Perdaman Chemicals and Fertilisers for the supply of pipeline gas from the Scarborough development. Last month, Woodside CEO Coleman said the company was slowing down marketing for the Scarborough development, despite a lot of interest for the gas, due to weak prices for Asian LNG, currently near a three-year low. In May last year, Woodside outlined plans to accelerate and expand the Scarborough project at an expected cost of $10 billion. Woodside in January pledged between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion towards projects this year, with most of that flowing into early work on the Scarborough and Browse gas developments, and expansion of its Pluto LNG plant in Australia. The company aims to double LNG production by 2027. ",-13.799999999999272,0
722," By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - The dollar scaled a three-week high versus the yen on Friday, lifted by expectations that a protracted trade dispute between the United States and China would be resolved soon. The greenback has gained about 0.85 percent against its safe-haven Japanese peer this week, thanks also to factors such as strong U.S. economic data and broad improvement in risk appetite. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday both countries were getting very close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks. On the economic front, investors will have an opportunity to gauge the health of the world's largest economy when the March U.S. jobs report is released at 1230 GMT.

The greenback extended overnight gains and rose to 111.80 yen, its highest since March 15. It last traded at 111.695. The dollar has rebounded 1.8 percent since slumping to a six-week trough of 109.70 yen on March 25. The U.S. currency had sunk to that low in the wake of a sharp slide by Treasury yields caused by risk aversion, triggered by growth concerns and a corresponding retreat by global equities. Treasury yields have bounced since, with encouraging economic indicators and trade optimism helping propel Wall Street shares rebound to six-month highs. ""Hopes for a trade resolution have further boosted stock prices, but their gains now look too stretched,"" said Makoto Noji, chief forex and foreign bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""The 'risk on' phase could be reaching a climax, and even if the United States and China do reach a trade agreement, that could trigger 'sell the fact' moves.""

725," MEXICO CITY, April 4 (Reuters) - If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal it could have ""very significant"" costs for some parts of the British economy, Roberto Azevedo, Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO), said on Thursday. The British government is scrambling to find parliamentary consensus over the terms of its departure from the European Union ahead of an April 12 deadline, prompting warnings from some officials that the risk of a no-deal exit is increasing. Azevedo said in Mexico City that economists were best placed to estimate the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit, which would leave the British economy trading on WTO rules. Separately, Azevedo sounded a note of caution on ongoing efforts to resolve a dispute over the future of the WTO's Appellate Body, the top court of global trade. Washington has long argued that WTO judges have routinely broken with procedures and exceeded their mandates, and in a bid to force reforms, the U.S. government has blocked the appointment of judges to the Appellate Body. If continued, the tactic could render the body inoperable by December, when terms end for two of the remaining three judges. Under WTO rules, three judges are required to hear appeals. Azevedo said WTO member states were seeking to find a way around the impasse, noting that it was chiefly a U.S. concern. ""The truth is that it's difficult to know if we're advancing or not,"" he said, ""because the Americans haven't been contributing in a very active way to these discussions."" ",-13.799999999999272,0
726," The idea of retiring can be daunting from a financial perspective, since it often entails moving over to a fixed income with variable expenses. And if there's one expense that has retirees worried, it's healthcare . Not only do medical issues tend to creep up with age, but often, Medicare will only cover a portion of them. Throw in the fact that many seniors enter retirement without a clue as to what healthcare will cost, and it's no wonder so many wind up struggling financially. With that in mind, investment giant Fidelity recently shared some projections designed to help Americans get a better handle on their senior healthcare costs. A 65-year-old couple retiring this year can expect to spend $285,000 on medical expenses throughout retirement. For single retirees, that number is $150,000 for women (since they tend to live longer) and $135,000 for men.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. These numbers might seem staggering -- but they also might be somewhat conservative. HealthView Services, a cost projection software provider, has a different take on healthcare costs in retirement. In a report released last year, it found that the average healthy 65-year-old couple retiring in 2018 should expect to pay $363,946 for medical care in retirement. That figure includes Medicare premiums as well as the cost of supplemental insurance. It's also meant to cover healthy seniors. For someone with preexisting medical issues, that number could get a lot higher. Now clearly, there's a substantial discrepancy between Fidelity's estimates and those of HealthView. But no matter which number you choose to run with, know this: You'll need to save aggressively if you don't want healthcare to derail your finances in retirement. Though estimates like the ones referenced earlier can give you a general sense of what medical care might cost you as a senior, healthcare in retirement can be somewhat unpredictable, as it'll depend on the specific issues you encounter. Your best bet, therefore, is to assume the worst and save for it. Currently, workers 50 and over can contribute up to $25,000 a year to a 401(k). If you have that option, maxing out for the next 15 years will add $628,000 to your savings if your investments deliver an average annual 7% return during that time (which is doable if you load up stocks, since the market has averaged a slightly higher return historically). If you don't have access to a 401(k) plan, you can work on building savings in an IRA. Just know that the annual contribution limit for workers 50 and older is just $7,000, which means you won't see the same results as you would by maxing out a 401(k). That said, there's another way to save for healthcare in retirement that doesn't involve a 401(k) or an IRA. If you're eligible for a health savings account , or HSA, you can set aside funds during your working years to pay for medical expenses in the future. To qualify for an HSA, you must have a high-deductible plan -- $1,350 for single coverage, or $2,700 for family coverage. From there, you can contribute up to $3,500 this year if you have individual coverage, or $7,000 if you have family coverage. And if you're 55 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution on top of the aforementioned figures. HSA contributions, like those made in a traditional 401(k) or IRA, go in on a pre-tax basis, and once you fund your account, you can invest your money so that it grows over time. You'll then be eligible for tax-free withdrawals from your HSA provided you spend that money on qualified medical expenses. Though you can use your HSA to pay for healthcare year after year, if you manage to leave much of that money untouched, it can grow into a larger sum so that you're left with a sizable balance to access in retirement, when you might need that money the most. No matter what steps you take to save for the whopping expense that is healthcare in retirement, make sure you're realistic about the costs you might one day face. While you may not manage to predict exactly what your medical needs will entail, you can bet on them eating up a substantial portion of your retirement budget .

727," SYDNEY, April 5 (Reuters) - Shares in Australian medical imaging and cancer-treatment firms rose on Friday after the opposition Labor party promised increased spending in the sector, weeks out from an election that opinion polls suggest they will win in a landslide. The stock price gains added a cumulative A$100 million ($70 million) to the market capitalisation of the four biggest movers and underscored how seriously equity markets are pricing in a centre-left Labor victory at a vote due by the end of May. Imagery firms Integral Diagnostics Ltd and Capitol Health Ltd posted the largest gains, rising more than 4 percent in early trade, after Labor leader Bill Shorten promised A$600 million to subsidise cancer-related scans. ""The market is pricing in all the Labor policies,"" he said. Australia's second-largest medical centre operator, Healius Ltd, rose 3 percent, while skin-regeneration firm Avita Medical Ltd rose as much as 3.7 percent. The broader market fell half a percentage point. Shorten promised the A$600 million in imagery spending over four years as part of a A$2.3 billion cancer-care package that dramatically broadens government subsidies for treating the condition, which is one of Australia's biggest killers. The package also includes A$433 million to cover consultations with cancer specialists. ""One in two Australians will be diagnosed with cancer during their life ... we're going to help people be in the fight of their life, be alongside them,"" he told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio on Friday. ""That is what people pay their taxes for,"" he said. Campaigning has already begun in earnest for an election that is set to be called imminently and must be held by the end of May. Opinion polling shows Prime Minister Scott Morrison's centre-right coalition government on track for defeat after six tumultuous years in power during which two prime ministers were toppled by internal ructions. The government offered broad income tax cuts and promised infrastructure spending in a pre-election budget on Tuesday. Integral Diagnostics Chief Executive Officer Ian Kadish welcomed the cancer funding promises, which he said would improve patients' access to scans. Capitol, Healius and Avita did not respond immediately to requests for comment.  ($1 = 1.4071 Australian dollars) ",-13.799999999999272,0

730," By Stanley White TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Japan's household spending rose less than expected in February and real wages tumbled at the fastest pace in more than three years, raising concerns about the hit to the consumer sector from heightening global uncertainties. The data is likely to be discussed by policymakers worried that risks to the export sector from ongoing trade disputes may discourage firms from raising wages, which in turn would hurt consumption. Taken with separate wages data, also released on Friday, the numbers suggested household income may not be strong enough to underpin consumption at a time when exports and output are weakening due to the U.S.-Sino trade war. The data also suggest the government could come under pressure to delay a planned sales tax hike and turn to the Bank of Japan (BOJ) for help in supporting the economy. ""Labour shortages are not pushing up wages, and you need wages to rise for inflation expectations to rise,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities. ""The BOJ is on hold for now, but it may have to come up with something if there is another downside shock to the economy."" The growth in household consumption in February was driven by spending on autos and mobile phone charges. Inflation-adjusted real wages in Japan fell 1.1 percent in February from a year ago, the fastest decline since June 2015. The soft household sector indicators follow signs of similar weakness in the corporate sector. Japan's business mood slumped to a two-year low in the March quarter, a central bank survey showed on April 1, highlighting the impact the Sino-U.S. trade war was having on sentiment and economic activity. Factories across Japan depend heavily on selling electronic parts and heavy equipment to manufacturers in China, which leaved Japan exposed to tit-for-tat tariffs between Washington and Beijing. The data on consumer spending and wages is likely to raise concerns about the economy. There are still risks to domestic demand, and expectations may heighten for the BOJ to ease monetary policy further. The government plans to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October to generate extra revenue for rising welfare costs. Some economists and politicians worry that if this plan is not delayed then consumer spending will weaken after the tax hike. The BOJ is in a bind over how to manage the economy. Years of heavy money printing and prolonged ultra-low rates have dried up the bond market and squeezed profits at banks, prompting Japan's banking lobby to urge the BOJ to rethink its monetary stimulus. However, Japan's economic outlook this year is weaker than last year's, which supports the argument that the BOJ will eventually need to come up with some measures to keep already low inflation from slowing.

731," It's not often that investors can get the best of both worlds by finding a high-yield stock with a high growth rate. However, that's exactly what BP Midstream Partners (NYSE: BPMP) offers. The master limited partnership ( MLP ) not only pays an attractive 8.4%-yielding distribution, but the company firmly believes it can grow that payout at a mid-teens rate through at least next year. That potentially sets investors up to earn some high-octane total returns. Oil giant BP (NYSE: BP) formed BP Midstream Partners in late 2017 to acquire and operate its U.S. midstream assets . BP seeded its MLP with interests in several onshore and offshore oil, natural gas, and refined products pipelines systems backed by long-term, fee-based contracts. Those agreements supply BP Midstream with predictable cash flow, the bulk of which it uses to pay its lucrative distribution.  Image source: Getty Images. BP Midstream's portfolio generated enough cash last year to cover its high-yielding distribution by a comfortable 1.21 times, including 1.29 times during the fourth quarter. That increasing cushion came even though the company boosted its payout by a mid-teens rate last year. As a result, the company was able to retain some excess cash to further bolster its financial profile so it can fund growth-focused investments. BP Midstream used its financial flexibility to complete its first drop-down transaction with BP last October. BP Midstream paid $468 million for interests in two pipeline systems and a stake in a refined products terminal joint venture. That deal, when combined with the organic growth of the company's existing portfolio, will give it the cash flow to increase its distribution by a mid-teen rate again this year. BP Midstream currently has enough cash flow cushion to easily support another 5% to 6% distribution increase next year. However, the company believes it can use a combination of excess cash and additional borrowings to complete another transaction with BP. It's aiming to make a deal that would support mid-teens distribution growth again in 2020 while staying within its targeted financial metrics. BP currently holds stakes in several midstream assets that it could drop down to its MLP, including onshore and offshore pipelines, storage tanks at its refineries, and its distribution and business-to-business marketing operations. BP controls enough midstream assets that it could support steady growth at its MLP for the next several years, providing BP Midstream can secure attractive financing for future transactions. On top of that, BP Midstream's offshore pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico have significant organic growth potential due to recent discoveries near its existing operations. As projects to tap those resources advance, it could bring additional growth opportunities to BP Midstream. These two growth drivers could provide BP Midstream with the fuel to continue growing its payout at a healthy rate for years to come. The main attraction at BP Midstream is its high-yielding distribution. Not only does the company support that payout with conservative financial metrics, but it has the backing of BP. On top of that, the company offers investors fast-paced growth for at least the next two years. It has already locked up double-digit distribution growth this year and should be able to do the same in 2020 with the support of BP. That combination of income and growth has BP Midstream positioned to richly reward its investors in the coming years, making it an intriguing opportunity worth considering.  10 stocks we like better than BP Midstream Partners LP

732," TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday, with Brent slipping away from the $70 mark after briefly rising above that level in the previous session, as traders fretted about progress in U.S.-China talks to end a trade war. International benchmark Brent futures dropped 23 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $69.17 a barrel by 0040. On Thursday, they closed 9 cents higher after touching a session high of $70.03, the highest since Nov. 12. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 2 cents at $62.08. The contract fell 36 cents in the previous session, having hit hit $62.99 on Wednesday, its highest since November. ""A summit in April is looking unlikely despite the comments from both sides on how well the negotiations are going,"" Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. ""After much talk there is still nothing to show for it, which is once again putting downward pressure on energy demand going forward,"" Esparza said. Brent has gained nearly 30 percent this year, while WTI has risen nearly 40 percent, underpinned by U.S. sanctions on Iranian and Venezuelan crude, OPEC production cuts and rising global demand. But bearish economic indicators this week, including lower German factory orders, may be putting a cap on those gains. German industrial orders fell in February by the sharpest rate in more than two years, according to data released Thursday. Orders were hit by a slump in foreign demand, compounding worries that Europe's largest economy had a weak start to the year. ",-13.799999999999272,0

735," April 4 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc'sGoogle said on Thursday it was dissolving a council it had formed a week earlier to consider ethical issues around artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The council had run into controversy over two of its members, according to online news portal Vox, which first reported the dissolution of the council. The council, launched on March 26, was meant to provide recommendations for Google and other companies and researchers working in areas such as facial recognition software, a form of automation that has prompted concerns about racial bias and other limitations. ""It's become clear that in the current environment, ATEAC can't function as we wanted. So we're ending the council and going back to the drawing board,"" a Google representative said in an emailed statement. The Vox said Google employees had signed a petition calling for the removal of one of the members over comments about transsexual people, and added that the inclusion of a drone company executive had raised debate over use of Google's AI for military applications.

736," By Jonathan Cable LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Sterling will rally 3 percent if the Brexit gridlock is resolved and Britain looks likely to leave the European Union with a deal but the currency will tumble 5 percent if negotiations fail, a Reuters poll found. The pound tanked after the June 2016 referendum result -- as predicted by Reuters polls beforehand -- and was trading at around $1.31 on Thursday, far weaker than it was ahead of the vote. On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would seek another Brexit delay to agree an EU divorce deal with the opposition Labour Party leader, a last-ditch gambit to break an impasse over Britain's departure. Nearly three years since the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU in a shock referendum result, it is still unclear how, when or even if it will ever quit the European club it joined in 1973. May secured a Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in November but has failed to get the support of British lawmakers, leaving the country's road out of the EU unclear. If that road is smooth and Britain leaves with a deal, sterling will gain around 3 percent, the April 1-4 poll predicted. If the road is blocked and no deal is made, the pound will fall 5 percent. ""Looser fiscal policy and a Brexit deal could lead to higher interest rates and push up the pound,"" said Thomas Pugh at Capital Economics. Another option is that Britain asks for a long delay to Brexit which would prolong the uncertainty. But if it looks like the road out will be extended, the pound will edge up around 1.75 percent, according to the poll. ""Political clouds could be darkening the skies over the outlook for GBP for a long time yet,"" said Jane Foley at Rabobank. Foley was the most accurate forecaster for major currencies in Reuters polls last year. The wider poll of nearly 70 foreign exchange strategists said the pound would be trading at $1.32 in a month, $1.35 in six months and have strengthened to $1.38 in a year, indicating respondents do not expect a disorderly Brexit. But highlighting the uncertainty, the 12-month forecast range was wide, going from $1.27 to $1.56. A Reuters poll of economists last month found the vast majority of them saying the two sides would settle eventually on a free-trade deal, as they have in all Reuters polls since late 2016. That poll also predicted the Bank of England would raise borrowing costs towards the end of this year and then again in the latter half of 2020. In contrast, the European Central Bank will not be raising interest rates until at least July next year, another Reuters poll predicted, but that differential won't give the pound any support against the common currency. Across all four touch points in the forecast horizon -- one, three, six and 12 months -- one euro was predicted to be worth 85.0 pence. It was valued at around 85.3p on Thursday.

To be sure, Momo stock climbed 12% just on March 12, 2019 alone after the company revealed its fourth-quarter revenue had climbed 50% year over year to $559.1 million -- well above its guidance for 43% to 47% growth -- which translated to a better-than-expected 22% increase in adjusted (non- GAAP ) net income attributable to Momo to $129.1 million, or $0.59 per American depositary share (ADS).

The underlying drivers of Momo's business were encouraging: Monthly active users for the Momo app climbed 14.3% to 113.3 million, and total paying users of its live video service and value-added service grew nearly 67% to 13 million. Momo Chairman and CEO Yan Tang called it a ""solid quarter,"" adding, ""I am pleased with the progress we made in 2018 in product innovation, monetization, financial performance and the strengthening of the company's position as a leading player in China's open social space."" Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2019, Momo told investors to expect revenue to increase in the range of 28% to 32% at constant currencies. That's a hefty deceleration from the 50% increase it achieved to end 2018, but most analysts were anticipating first-quarter growth closer to 19%.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed and near its highest since the end of August. It was still up 1.9 percent for the week and 13 percent for the year so far. ""Share markets have run hard and fast from their December lows and are vulnerable to a short-term pullback,"" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital.

Xinhua reported Chinese President Xi Jinping had said progress was being made and called for an early conclusion of negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday a deal could be announced in about four weeks, but warned it would be difficult to let China trade with the United States if remaining issues were not resolved. Investors are also waiting on the U.S. payrolls report which is forecast to bounce back by 180,000 in March, following February's distorted 20,000 rise. One focus will be hourly earnings which climbed to 3.4 percent in February, the fastest pace since April 2009. Hopes for a solid number were boosted by data on jobless claims which fell to a 49-year low last week, pointing to sustained labour market strength.

739," By Shrutee Sarkar BENGALURU, April 5 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will delay any interest rate hikes further into next year than previously thought as euro zone economic growth and inflation prospects have dimmed, a Reuters poll of economists showed. That change comes only a few months after the central bank shut its monthly asset purchases, known as quantitative easing (QE), and March's offer of new long-term loans, or TLTROs, to start in September. The ECB is already on its longest break from changing rates and this week's poll of more than 80 economists showed the central bank will delay any tightening even further. ""To some extent, the ECB's concerns are understandable as its toolbox is empty. Of course, when push comes to shove, the ECB could restart QE. They could even follow the BoJ in its footsteps, buying equities at some point,"" said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank. ""But after massive QE, negative deposit rates and strong forward guidance, core inflation for March still stood just 0.2 percent shy of its all-time low. So the ECB may well prove to be relatively powerless."" The poll showed the ECB is expected to lift interest rates later next year, but inflation was forecast to remain below the Bank's target of just under 2 percent for at least the next three years. Inflation was forecast to average 1.4 percent in 2019, 1.5 percent in 2020 and 1.6 percent in 2021, broadly unchanged from last month. ""The ECB cannot increase rates just yet, simply because inflation is too weak. They will continue to reinvest everything that comes to maturity in their asset portfolio at least until 2021,"" said Julien Manceaux, senior economist at ING. The consensus was for the euro zone economy to grow between 0.2 and 0.4 percent each quarter through to the end of next year, a slight downgrade from last month. One contributor forecast outright contraction next year. Twenty-nineteen and 2020 growth outlooks for big euro zone economies were downgraded or at best left unchanged in the latest poll compared with the January poll. Still, the ECB is forecast to raise its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.30 percent in the third quarter of 2020, according to the consensus, compared with a second quarter hike expected in the previous poll. But whether the first rate hike comes in the third or fourth quarter was on a knife edge. Of economists with a view that far out, 51 percent predicted rates to have risen by the end of the third quarter next year and over 55 percent expect it by end-2020. The refinancing rate was forecast to remain on hold at zero through to the end of next year at least. Last month, a hike was expected at the end of next year. This latest poll was also the first since 2016 when any respondent has forecast the deposit rate would be cut further. That call echoes eonia money market futures, which have priced in a small chance of a rate cut this year. ""We think a U.S. recession in 2020 will prevent any further normalisation moves and instead push the ECB to more accommodative monetary policy in September 2020,"" noted Michel Martinez, chief economist for Europe at Societe Generale. But over 65 percent of economists who answered an additional question said they were confident the euro zone economy would recover significantly from its current downturn. The remaining said they were not. The median probability of a recession in the euro zone was unchanged at 20 percent in the next 12 months and 30 percent in the next two years. ""Both the ECB and the Fed have turned incrementally more dovish. If all else were to remain constant, this should provide support to the economy and risk assets,"" noted Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research at Barclays. ",-13.799999999999272,0
740," BRASILIA, April 4 (Reuters) - The government of Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has rejected an appeal by a United Nations expert not to revise Brazilian history by denying a military coup occurred in 1964. In a letter to the U.N. human rights commission in Geneva made public on Thursday, the government said it ""repudiates the baseless allegations"" of the U.N. expert who criticized Bolsonaro's decision to commemorate the 1964 military uprising as an attempt to condone rights violations. ""President Bolsonaro has reiterated his understanding that the 1964 movement was necessary to stave off the growing threat of a communist takeover of Brazil and to ensure the preservation of national institutions in the context of the Cold War,"" the letter said. Brazil's armed forces on Sunday paid tribute to the 1964 coup that lead to a two-decade military dictatorship at the behest of Bolsonaro, who reversed an eight-year-ban on celebrations. The move stirred debate and underscored Bolsonaro's support for a military government that executed hundreds, tortured thousands, shuttered Congress and left most Brazilians with dark memories of the period. Two days earlier in Geneva, Fabian Salvioli, the U.N. expert who wrote the letter and a human rights lawyer and professor, called on the Bolsonaro government to reconsider the commemoration. ""Attempts to revise history and justify or condone gross human rights violations of the past must be clearly rejected by all authorities and society as a whole,"" Salvioli said. Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, has long praised the 1964-85 military government and often said its biggest mistake was not killing enough leftists. Pushing the U.N. appeal aside, his government is moving ahead with rewriting history. Education Minister Ricardo Velez said in an interview published on Wednesday that school history books will be edited to give a ""broader"" view of what happened in 1964. He told Valor Economico newspaper that there was no coup and the military regime that followed was not a dictatorship. ",-13.799999999999272,0
741," Shares of fuel cell maker Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) climbed 34% in March, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . Consequently, shares have nearly doubled since the start of the year. While the release of the company's Q4 earnings motivated some investors to pick up shares early in the month, the bullish momentum extended through the rest of the month thanks to an analyst's resumption of coverage on the stock and management's concerted effort to rebuild trust with shareholders.  Image source: Getty Images. In early March, Plug Power treated its shareholders to something that they had never enjoyed before: an earnings report featuring positive adjusted EBITDA . The $500,000 adjusted EBITDA that the company reported may not seem substantial, but in light of the fact that Plug Power reported negative $7.6 million during the same period in 2017, it's certainly noteworthy. Suggesting that this progress toward profitability wouldn't be an isolated incident, management forecast the company would be adjusted-EBITDA positive in 2019. Contributing to the momentum that Plug Power's stock gained after its earnings release, an analyst with B. Riley FBR, Christopher Van Horn, resumed coverage on the stock in mid-March according to TheFly.com . In addition to maintaining the buy rating, which B. Riley FBR previously had on the stock, the analyst maintained the price target of $3.50, which had been assigned during the stock's previous coverage. Although company insiders will sell shares of their companies for a variety of reasons, they, presumably, will only buy shares for one reason: They expect the stocks to rise. So when Andy Marsh, Plug Power's CEO, kept his word in mid-March and followed through with his announced intent to adopt a 10b5-1 stock trading plan, picking up $30,000 in Plug's stock on the open market, investors took note. But he wasn't alone. The company's chairman of the board, George McNamee, also increased his position in the company, picking up 100,000 shares on the open market in a transaction valued at roughly $234,000. But it wasn't only the stock purchases that helped the stock to gain favor in the eyes of investors. Seeking to rebuild trust with shareholders, Marsh also hosted an Ask Me Anything session on Quora in March, attempting to provide a greater sense of transparency. This followed a similar session that he hosted on Reddit in February. While Plug Power, like March itself, roared loudly in the beginning of the month, the stock never let up, ending the month much like it began -- bearing little resemblance to a lamb. But it was Marsh's decision to put his money where his mouth is and pick up shares on the open market that I think spoke the loudest to investors last month -- that and his apparent commitment to improve the company's communication to shareholders.  10 stocks we like better than Plug Power

742," The chances are high that you've heard of AT&T (NYSE: T)  as it's one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. It's also a financial powerhouse, raking in $170.8 billion in revenue in 2018 and throwing off a whopping $22.4 billion in free cash flow . To be quite frank, AT&T stock isn't going to be at the top of any growth investor's list -- the company is expected to see its revenue grow by 7.8% in 2019 before slowing to just 0.4% in 2020. Moreover, it's not a stock investors can reliably count on for share-price appreciation, as the shares have effectively been trading sideways for years.  Image source: Getty Images. But if you're a dividend-focused investor looking to put your capital to work to build a large and growing income stream, then AT&T is a really interesting stock. Allow me to explain. At its current price, AT&T stock pays a dividend yield of about 6.45%. Moreover, that yield isn't some sort of unsustainable trap -- AT&T generates more than enough free cash flow to easily cover that yield as well as execute on its plan of paying down its sizable debt load . (AT&T has made a lot of sizable acquisitions over the years.) AT&T also has a long track record of raising its dividend payments each year. Granted, those dividend raises haven't been particularly large in recent years -- the company has boosted its quarterly dividend by a penny each year for many years now. I also expect that when AT&T gets around to boosting its dividend early next year, it'll be another $0.01 per share jump. Another thing to consider is that the business in which AT&T participates is quite dependable. Even in economic downturns, people are still going to need to use cell phones (AT&T is a major wireless carrier), they're still going to want to watch TV, and businesses are still going to need their wireline connections. That's not to say AT&T wouldn't suffer in a recession, but it'd still likely generate enough cash to fuel its dividend. Indeed, for some perspective, AT&T's annual dividend payments currently work out to $2.04 per share. The company's free cash flow per share over the last 12 months came out to about $3.36. This means AT&T can, in theory, sustain its current dividend (or, frankly, an even larger one) even if its free cash flow were to see a significant, temporary decline. Moreover, if you look at the trend in AT&T's free cash flow per share, you'll note that even during the financial crisis, that value stayed well above $2 per share.  T Free Cash Flow Per Share (TTM) data by YCharts . AT&T is a resilient business, and that resilience should make it attractive to dividend investors. If you're investing in a stock like AT&T, then your investment objective probably isn't to multiply your money in a relatively short amount of time -- you're probably looking to build out a dependable stream of passive income. For a high-yielding stock like AT&T, a share price that effectively goes nowhere can actually be advantageous in that pursuit. The idea goes something like this. Suppose you were to invest $500,000 in AT&T stock at $32 per share (slightly higher than what it's trading at as of this writing). At that share price, you'd be able to buy about 15,625 shares. Those shares would provide you with income of $32,211 per year. Now, suppose that AT&T stock doesn't budge, and over the next decade, you reinvest the dividends that you get from AT&T straight into more AT&T stock. Also, for the sake of simplicity, suppose AT&T raises its quarterly dividend by $0.01 each year. Here's how such a hypothetical portfolio and dividend payment schedule would evolve over that time. Data source: author calculations. In just 10 years, a $500,000 investment would grow to more than $900,000, and the income the portfolio would generate would grow from less than $32,000 to more than $68,000 under these assumptions. Now, keep in mind that inflation makes it so that a certain amount of money 10 years from now doesn't have the same purchasing power that the same amount of money would have today. Nevertheless, a high-yielding stock with a steadily increasing dividend and a relatively flat share price can still be interesting to the right kind of investor. Dividend investing is great because it leverages the power of compounding to help investors build wealth over time. If dividend investing is something you're interested in, then AT&T, with its strong core business and large and growing dividend, is a dividend stock worth considering.  10 stocks we like better than AT&T

743," It's been about a week since Lyft 's (NASDAQ: LYFT) stock went public, but already, many investors have rushed to judgment about the ridesharing company's prospects for future success. The share price spent so much of this week below its $72 per-share offering price that Lyft quickly gained a label as a busted IPO. A rush of negativity about the launch sought to highlight the risks and less attractive attributes of the company. Yet amid all the hype, Lyft has actually done an admirable job of going public in a way that almost perfectly balances the interests of investors and the company itself. In an era in which many investors expect to see huge first-day jumps for IPOs, Lyft might not have delivered the success that some of its early shareholders would have preferred. But it will take far longer than a week for a fair assessment of whether the fledgling business can grow to its full potential.  Image source: Lyft. It's important for investors to remember that the underlying purpose of an initial public offering isn't just to create a market for shares. IPOs are also intended to help companies raise cash for additional investment. The more cash a company can get for its initial shares, the more it can invest in growing its business without having to return to the capital markets later for additional funds through follow-up offerings that dilute the company's value. With that in mind, it's pretty clear that the modern measure of IPO success -- the size of the first-day jump -- is fundamentally flawed. If a newly public stock doubles in price on its first day from its IPO price, then it's a huge win for those who participated in the offering. But it's also a big loss for the company because it essentially offered shares at half of what the market thought their true value should be. Consider what happened right before Lyft went public. Leading up to the IPO, the ridesharing service had anticipated pricing its stock at between $62 and $68 per share. If it had gone with the $68 price, then Lyft's first-day jump would've been 15% rather than 9%. And although the stock has flirted with lower prices, it didn't close below that $68 level in its first five days of trading. It closed Thursday at $72. Yet because Lyft dared to price its offering $4 per share higher -- reaping about $130 million in extra cash for the company -- potential new investors seem to have a completely different opinion of how the IPO went. Critics are blaming Lyft's losses for holding back excitement about the future of the company's business and they seem to be looking for reasons to be downbeat about Lyft's strategic vision. The more important reason why all the first-week hype about Lyft is meaningless is that investing has nothing to do with how a company does in seven days and everything to do with how it does over seven years -- or longer. To be fair, there are plenty of good reasons to be skeptical about Lyft's long-term prospects . Losses have been extensive and are getting worse, with 2018's $911 million in red ink marking a 32% jump from 2017's loss levels. Lyft has a clear duopolistic competitor in Uber, and a host of other upstart ridesharing providers are also competing for riders. Even automakers are getting into the game, looking potentially to offer services of their own and potentially bypassing the intermediary opportunity that Lyft and others are seeking to exploit. Some investors also weren't happy with the voting control that co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer retained through their retention of stock in a special share class with superior voting rights. Yet Lyft could look a lot different in seven years. Active ridership, the number of rides, and overall revenue have been growing sharply over the past few years, and revenue per active rider has been increasing, as well. Lyft seems to be gaining a core audience of loyal riders , and controversy about Uber has pushed some customers to consider Lyft as an alternative. There has been a lot of discussion about the treatment of drivers for ridesharing companies, but those problems could disappear entirely if the autonomous driving technology that Lyft is working on eventually makes having a person at the wheel unnecessary. The fact that car giant General Motors  has a stake in Lyft also reduces the chances that automakers will seek to do an end-run around ridesharing and instead will make partnerships with the leaders of the industry. Lyft's ups and downs over its first week of trading make for good headlines, but in the context of investing in the company, they're irrelevant. It'll take years to judge Lyft's true success, and it might come in a form that no one can even foresee right now.  10 stocks we like better than Lyft

757," Whether your retirement is decades away or just around the corner - or you're already living the dream - there are a few simple things you can do now to lower your taxes. Taxes? In retirement? Yes and yes. A chunk of your Social Security benefits likely will be taxed. The money you take out of your traditional IRA and 401(k) will be taxed. And investments you have in a regular brokerage account may face taxes on capital gains and dividends. The following ideas could save you big time - making your retirement years a little less stressful. Hands down, the easiest way to trim your tax bill in retirement is to put money into a Roth IRA today . Rules apply, but follow them and everything you put into the Roth - your contributions as well as the money you earn in that account - comes out tax-free in retirement. ""That's one really good way"" to lower your retirement tax bill, says Alan J. Straus, a certified public accountant and attorney in New York City. There are a few ways to open a Roth: There is a downside (hey, nothing's perfect): With a Roth IRA, the tax break comes later. You put money into the account after paying taxes on it. That's unlike a traditional IRA or 401(k), both of which give you an upfront tax break. Maybe think of the Roth as current pain for long-term gain. This one's only for people who have a high-deductible health insurance plan. As long as the health plan you have meets the IRS's guidelines (among other rules, the deductible must be at least $1,350 for an individual plan and $2,700 for a family plan), you're allowed to open a health savings account, which is one of the sweetest savings deals around. You get to put money in pre-tax, that money then grows tax-deferred and, as long as you spend the money on qualified health costs, you never pay taxes on it. The annual HSA contribution limit is $7,000 for a family plan and $3,500 for an individual in 2019. The less you need to withdraw from retirement accounts that require taxes on withdrawals, such as traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, the lower your tax bill. Given that a mortgage tends to be one of the biggest bills you could make withdrawals for, it makes sense to try to get it out of the way. By the time you retire, it's also likely you'll be paying mostly principal, not interest, and thus not getting much tax benefit from the mortgage interest deduction. Another idea? Consider moving to a cheaper state. You're probably not going to move somewhere for taxes alone, but if you're thinking of moving anyway, keep taxes mind. It could save you some big bucks. Some states don't have an income tax; some don't tax retirement income. If you have stocks with big price gains and you want to sell, maybe hold off selling those stocks until a year when your overall income - and thus your tax rate - is lower. ""In lower tax years, that might be a good year to harvest a capital gain for something you're thinking about selling,"" says Mark Luscombe, principal analyst with Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting in Riverwoods, Illinois. ""The inverse of that is to realize investment losses in what otherwise might be a higher income year."" Your losses first offset any capital gains, but net capital losses can offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year. Generally, municipal bonds are tax-exempt, meaning you won't owe federal tax (and may not owe state tax) on the income you receive. If they fit into your overall investment plans, that extra tax-free income could be a good thing. ""You suffer a little lower interest rate, but you can control when you withdraw that money and when you withdraw it, it is tax-free,"" Luscombe says. (There are some downsides, though. For example, you'll have to include your muni bond income for the purposes of taxing Social Security.) If you've got a traditional IRA or 401(k) and a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), then one way to control your taxes is to manage your withdrawals in retirement. In years when, for whatever reason, you're in a low tax bracket, consider withdrawing taxable money for your living expenses. In years when you're in a higher tax bracket, then it's smart to withdraw from your Roth IRA so your income isn't taxed at high rates. Similarly, you can use low-tax years to convert your traditional IRA to a Roth. When you pull money out of an IRA it becomes taxable, even when you're converting that money to a Roth . So it makes sense to do that in years when your income is low - and to convert just enough so that your income that year doesn't get pushed into a higher tax bracket. That way, you're paying a lower tax rate and getting all that money into an account where the money comes out tax-free. ""If you're having a terrible year income-wise and you have this traditional IRA money or traditional 401(k) money, then the years where you have low income you'll also be in a low tax bracket, so you could manage the amount of tax you're paying to move the money from regular to Roth,"" says Steven B. Zelin, a CPA and managing member of Zelin & Associates CPA LLC in New York. If you've reached the age where you have to start pulling money out of your traditional IRA, aka age 70½, consider donating to your favorite charities directly from your traditional IRA. That tax perk lets you avoid income tax on up to $100,000 per year. You can use all or a portion of that donation to count for your required minimum distribution from your IRA.  (But, if you do contribute from your IRA, you can't also claim a deductible charitable contribution for the same amount.)

WM
) stock was down as much as 5% earlier on Thursday as the company was downgraded by a reputable investment analyst. Stifel downgraded the Houston, Texas-based waste management business' stock from a buy to a neutral , leading to the sell-off. The firm said that the downgrade was not so much related to the company's core trash collecting business, as its fundamentals remain strong, the analyst said. Instead, Stifel said the downgrade was the result of weakening prices for recycled paper as WM's recycling business. The firm added that ""wet weather"" also played a role in its projection that the company's results will not be as strong as Stifel had previously believed it to be. All in all, Waste Management's stock is down a touch above 2.5% today, but that only tells part of the tale of the company's year as shares have gained 24.5% over the past year. This amount is stronger than the sub-10% performance of the S&P 500.

1547," China's hotbed of young anime fans is drawing more attention on Wall Street. UBS analyst Angela Xu initiated coverage of Bilibili (NASDAQ: BILI)  with a buy rating on Wednesday. She sees the fast-growing online community as uniquely positioned to cash in on the video content and games that are proving magnetic to its young users. Xu feels that Bilibili is still in the early innings of the monetization process. She's not alone. Wall Street pros see revenue tripling in three years. Xu is slapping a $23 price target on the stock, offering more than 30% of upside form current levels.  Image source: Bilibili. Bilibili is growing at a heady pace. Revenue rose 57% to hit $168 million in its latest quarter . The red ink widened in the process, but analysts aren't expecting profitability anytime soon. Bilibili's community continues to grow; it closed out 2018's final quarter with 92.8 million average monthly users, a 29% ascent over the past year. Revenue is growing roughly twice as fast, a testament to Bilibili's stickiness as well as its improving skills at monetizing its traffic. Revenue growth actually accelerated from the 48% gain it posted in the third quarter, and its user base gain also picked up the pace from its 26% showing in the prior period. Bilibili's guidance calls for top-line growth to decelerate to 45% for this year's first quarter, but it has already established itself as a serial low-baller with its quarterly outlooks. Bilibili has had a wild ride since going public at $11.50  13 months ago. The shares peaked at $22.70 in June, only to plummet to the single digits later in the summer as investor concerns about Chinese growth stocks in general and regulators cracking down on video games in the country in particular crushed the stock. Bilibili has been clawing its way back up ever since. The stock has been recovering nicely this year, though it cooled off earlier this month after the company completed a convertible bond and secondary stock offering. The shares have slipped below the $18 price of Bilibili's follow-on offering. Xu at UBS is stepping up in the lull, and her $23 price target would be an all-time high for the shares. Bilibili isn't a household name even for Chinese growth investors, but it's an intriguingly positioned dot-com. Mobile gaming is its largest revenue generator, but it's also growing even faster in advertising, live broadcasting, and value-added services. Its young audience -- 82% of its users were 18 or younger at the time of last year's IPO -- is one that marketers struggle to reach these days. Bilibili is convincing more of its users to pay for premium access, and the bullish thesis here is that the regulars will stick with the platform even as they age into the workforce with more disposable income in their pockets. In short, the game is just getting started.  10 stocks we like better than Bilibili

1552," The biotech industry has kept its promise for solid returns so far. The rally in some major biotechnology indexes reflects the same. In this context, the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index has returned 17.6% year to date. Following the trend, S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index has returned around 29%. With time, biotechnology is emerging as a favored sector for investors with some risk appetite and looking for attractive returns. Let's delve deeper into the trends favoring the biotechnology market space in 2019. Mergers & Acquisitions Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are dominating the sector as sluggishness in mature products has forced companies to explore acquisitions to bolster their pipeline. The biggest deal of the year was Bristol-Myers' acquisition offer of $74 billion to buy Celgene. Also, Eli Lilly and Company LLY has announced that it will take over Loxo Oncology for $8 billion to broaden its oncology suite to precision medicines or targeted therapies. (read: What's Behind the Biotech ETF Rally to Start 2019? ) Several other large-cap pharma as well as bigger biotech companies are entering collaboration deals with smaller ones to boost their pipeline. Notably, Swiss pharma giant Roche Holdings RHHBY has bet big on U.S.-based gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics ONCE in an effort to strengthen its presence in gene therapy. Similarly, in order to develop gene therapies targeting rare indications, Biogen has offered to buy Nightstar Therapeutics. Furthermore, in-licensing deals are consistently rising with bigwigs partnering with smaller and mid-sized players that own promising mid-to-late stage pipeline candidates or interesting technology. Regulatory Tidings The companies within the biotech sector gain majorly from positive pipeline-related advancements. Of late, the space has seen a series of developments. To begin with, Amgen and partner UCB recently received FDA approval for osteoporosis drug, Evenity, for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. Gilead Sciences recently submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for Descovy. Moreover, Celgene submitted a Biologics License Application for the pipeline candidate, luspatercept, a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent that regulates late-stage red blood cell maturation. Moreover, biotech bigwigs are increasingly focusing on a few drug categories like biosimilars, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases and gene therapies. In fact, per an article on InvestingNews.com , the FDA is increasingly encouraging companies to adopt means to develop gene therapy-related products. AI Ushers in a New Era The implications of AI, cloud-based technologies and increased R&D focus have lent a competitive edge to companies within the biotech space. The use of AI has gradually begun to revolutionize research activities in the industry as it can drastically reduce time and costs involved in developing life-saving drugs. Let's take a look at some instances on how AI is being used to advance in biotech. AiCure has developed an application that uses AI to govern if and at what time the patient takes a pill. Moreover, it is now being used regularly in many clinical trials. SOPHiA Genetics ' AI system is used for genomics analysis of next-generation sequencing data from hospitals and research institutions globally. Moreover, Illumina ILMN released an open source artificial intelligence software for discovering previously overlooked noncoding mutations in patients with rare genetic diseases in the beginning of 2019. In fact, J&J JNJ , Pfizer PFE and Novartis NVS have tie-ups with IBM's Watson Health. Per the deals, the companies can use Watson Health's AI solutions and applications for drug discovery and to accelerate cancer research efforts.

1553," If you owe a lot of money to the IRS, you probably shouldn't make overseas travel plans anytime soon: That unpaid tax bill could prompt the State Department to revoke your passport or reject your application for a new one. But before you start unpacking your suitcase, here are three things tax pros say you should know if you want to keep your tax debt from sending your passport on the wrong kind of vacation. Things have to be pretty bad for the IRS to come after your passport, says Eli Noff, a tax attorney and certified public accountant at Frost & Associates in Annapolis, Maryland. First, your overdue tax bill has to be more than $52,000, including interest and penalties. Second, the bill has to be ""seriously delinquent"" - that is, the IRS is basically at the end of its rope with you regarding trying to collect payment. Avoid the headache by responding to the IRS when it contacts you, Noff says. ""Usually when you file a tax return and there's a balance, there's a series of notices that the IRS will issue,"" he says. ""Either a notice of federal tax lien has been filed and your right to appeal has passed, or a notice of intent to levy has been filed and your right to appeal has passed. Once you've passed that, you're seriously delinquent."" It might take months to get to that point, Noff says, but when it does, fasten your seat belt - the IRS can tell the State Department to deny your passport application or even revoke your current passport. A government employee probably won't show up at your door to take your passport away, Noff says. But if you do hand it over, you may not get it back. ""Let's say you went to get some new pages for your passport, or your passport expired and you tried to get it renewed - they can either take it away or they can deny you a renewal,"" he says. If you're out of the country when the State Department puts a ground stop on your passport, it may issue you a limited one that's good for a direct return to the United States. Several rule exceptions might keep your passport off the red-eye to nowhere. Bankruptcy can put the brakes on things, for example, as can setting up an IRS debt-settlement agreement called an offer in compromise . Requesting innocent spouse relief might also work, as can living in a federal disaster area, being the victim of tax-related identity theft or demonstrating true financial hardship. You can also file suit in the U.S. Tax Court or a U.S. District Court if you think the IRS has flagged your passport in error. But perhaps the easiest way out of a passport pickle is just to pay your tax bill or get on a payment plan. The IRS offers installment programs that can help. ""If they're working it out with the IRS - if there's an offer to compromise even, or if there's an installment agreement, or if they're still going through a collections process - the passport revocation measures are not going to take effect,"" says James Curtis, a senior manager of international tax services at Hall & Company CPAs & Consultants in Irvine, California. But if you're hoping to catch that plane to Paris next week, your passport likely won't be ready in time, Noff says. All of those options can take the IRS weeks or months to process, he warns. Plus, the IRS has an additional 30 days to tell the State Department to give your passport the green light again. ""Probably somewhere between two to six weeks, I would say, is the quickest turnaround time,"" Noff says. And if you're also behind on your state taxes, make a plan for that, too, Noff says. Otherwise, you may have trouble renewing your driver's license and car registration - or your nursing license, real estate license or other professional license from the state. ""It's like anything else,"" Curtis says. ""It does not just go away if you ignore it.""  More From NerdWallet   Tina Orem is a writer at NerdWallet. Email: torem@nerdwallet.com.

1554," Bollinger Bands are an indicator that adapt to the market action to define what ""too high"" and ""too low"" mean. Many indicators use arbitrary levels to define high and low values. For example, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is considered oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought above 70. These static values fail to consider the market action and, in reality, an oversold market can become even more oversold. Arbitrary signal levels limit the usefulness of any technical indicator. Bollinger Bands adapt to the most recent market activity and move higher and lower along with the market. Overbought and oversold levels then reflect the reality of what is happening in the market now rather than being defined by an expert based on experiences from several decades ago. Bollinger Bands can be applied to price or to any indicator, and they can be found for any time frame. They are calculated using the standard deviation of recent data.  Using daily prices as an example, the first step would be to find the 20-day moving average of the closing prices. The standard deviation of that average would then be calculated. Default settings are to add 2 standard deviations to the average for the upper Band and subtract 2 standard deviations from the average to find the lower Band. When price is oversold, it will fall to the lower Band and often break below it. Overbought markets will see prices rise to the upper Band and above. The distance between the Bands will expand and contract with the market action, making this technical indicator a useful way to define volatility. How Traders Use It
Bollinger Bands could be used as a complete trading strategy. Traders can buy when the price rises back above the lower Band after closing below that level. Selling would be done when prices fall below the upper Band after closing above it. This simple strategy identified several winning trades in the chart below.  The chart of the PHLX Housing Sector index also shows how the Bands contract and expand, and that cycle of contracting and expanding plays out continuously in the markets. The Bands narrow when prices are in a trading range, and that is an indication to traders that volatility is likely to expand soon. Trading the most volatile stocks allows traders to seek the greatest profits in the shortest amount of time.

Why It Matters To Traders
Bollinger Bands adapt to the market. Traditional momentum indicators could signal that a market is oversold shortly after a powerful uptrend begins, and the indicator may continue to show that the market is oversold until well after the trend has reversed. Bollinger Bands are more adaptive and would offer a more reliable timing tool. Bollinger Bands also offer a way to visualize volatility. Many traders believe that volatility is more cyclical than price, i.e., periods of low volatility are followed by periods of high volatility and vice versa. When they see the width of the Bands begin to expand, traders can expect increased volatility in the price to follow, and this helps identify the best trading candidates. Other indicators, like Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) , could be combined with Bollinger Bands to determine the most likely direction of the expected breakout.

1555," Investors had low expectations heading into Bed Bath & Beyond 's (NASDAQ: BBBY) fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. The specialty retailer just came out of a tough holiday season that, while leaving it in a flexible financial position, raised questions about its prospects for an eventual growth rebound. This week's earnings announcement didn't ease those worries. Instead, Bed Bath & Beyond continued to struggle with reduced sales and falling profitability. Meanwhile, management declined to address the recent shareholder actions aimed at shaking up the executive team. Yet some of its moves appeared to be directed at neutralizing those criticisms. Let's take a closer look.  Image source: Getty Images. The broader growth trends didn't show improvement from the weak results investors have seen for a few years now. Comparable-store sales fell 1.4% as e-commerce gains failed to fully offset reduced traffic in the physical store base. That result landed comps at a 1.1% decline for the full year, or about even with management's forecast. Bed Bath & Beyond's comps have now dropped in each of the last three fiscal years, although the declines have all been modest at about 1%. Executives say they've been prioritizing profitability over near-term sales growth through strategies like removing low-margin products and scaling back on price cuts. Yet investors aren't seeing concrete benefits of these moves so far. Instead, gross profit margin fell to 34.7% of sales from 35.9% a year ago. For the full year, profitability landed at $4.1 billion, or 34%, compared to $4.4 billion, or 36%, in 2017. This metric has been steadily worsening since 2015, when it was above 38% of sales. Bed Bath & Beyond faced a major challenge in trying to cut costs while still investing in long-term growth initiatives. These moves left expenses about even with the prior year despite a lower sales base. As a result, operating margin fell for a third straight year. That metric has now fallen to below 4% from 12% in 2016. CEO Steven Temares and his team delivered the detailed update on their recovery plans that they promised investors in early January. The good news is the company sees modes t earnings growth returning to the business in 2019, or a full year ahead of their initial schedule . Looking deeper into the rebound targets, Bed Bath & Beyond is aiming for gross profit margin of around 36% of sales over the long term, which would return it to levels it achieved back in 2017. Operating margin should ideally land at 6% by 2020, or roughly double the current level. The company didn't predict whether its many merchandising changes will end its sales slide this year, and so investors can assume continuity in the current strategy that pairs modest customer traffic declines with reduced promotions. As for the activist investor challenge , Bed Bath & Beyond took a few actions apparently aimed at beating back that confrontation. It raised its dividend while announcing a comprehensive review of its management structure and compensation practices. The company also sped up plans to add more independent directors to the board. Executives have to hope that these changes, plus their forecasts predicting improving financial trends beginning this year, will convince shareholders to reject the activist investor attempt to toss out the management team in the upcoming annual shareholders' meeting.  10 stocks we like better than Bed Bath & Beyond

1562,"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel , in trading on Thursday, shares of CoreSite Realty Corp (Symbol: COR) were yielding above the 4% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $4.4), with the stock changing hands as low as $109.31 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF ( IWV ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 4% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. CoreSite Realty Corp (Symbol: COR) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.

A crosscurrent of catalysts remain in play, from evidence of nascent energy-push inflation to more promises of dovishness from central bankers and the still undelivered promise of a U.S.-China trade deal. And of course, we are nearing the start of the first-quarter earnings reporting season with big bank stocks set to lead the way. Investors seems to be pricing in some good news, however, with the financial sector perking up in what looks to be a potential breakout from a seven-month consolidation range. Inflation pressure could push long-term interest rates back up, helping net interest margins. And hopes are high for a resurgence of the housing market this summer. Both would be positive catalysts for the sector. Here are four big bank stocks showing strength:   Shares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:

), that gives users 2% cash back when used on Apple Watch or iPhone. The big bank stock will next report results on April 15 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $5.02 per share on revenues of $8.9 billion. When the company last reported on January 16, earnings of $6.04 beat estimates by $1.26 on a 0.5% decline in revenues.   JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:

In testimony before a Congressional hearing on Wednesday, CEO Jamie Dimon defended the company's post-crisis actions and explained why he believed the financial system was safer now. JPM will next report results on April 12 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.35 per share on revenues of $28.1 billion. When the company last reported on January 15, earnings of $1.98 per share missed estimates by 21 cents on an 8.1% rise in revenues.   Morgan Stanley (NYSE:

), offering a yield of 1.4%, isn't the most generous of dividend stocks. However, in my opinion, it's one of the safest places to earn passive income. Let's get the low-hanging fruit out of the way. First, American Express is a well-known and established credit provider and financial institution. This is a business that will likely not fade into obscurity, irrespective of economic conditions. Moreover, AXP caters to an affluent client base relative to its competitors. Second, AXP has significant international expansion opportunities. While American Express enjoys acceptance in over 130 countries , that's significantly below MasterCard's (NYSE:
MA
) 210-plus countries. And MasterCard isn't the number one credit card …  Visa (NYSE:
V
) is. While seemingly a disadvantage, this allows AXP to steal market share. Based on its resurgent revenue stream, the company is on the right track.  Dividend Yield: 5% I must admit that I'm not the biggest fan of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:
UNH
). By their nature, insurance providers don't offer the most upside potential in the markets. That said, health insurance is, and will continue to be a massively lucratively market, if only for cynical reasons. In July, I mentioned that the average American lifestyle is shockingly unhealthy . Furthermore, we're simply not kicking our habit of eating processed foods and living sedentary lives. Beyond that, UNH features consistently strong revenue growth, and barring unusual events, this year will be no different. On the yield front, UNH again isn't the most lavish among dividend stocks to buy. But the company's very predictable free cash flow and overall industry provide significant confidence for prospective investors.  Dividend Yield: 1.57% It's not often that you celebrate professional failure. But for Disney (NYSE:
DIS
), Wall Street apparently sees the silver lining after the iconic entertainment firm lost a bidding war to long-time rival Comcast (NASDAQ:
CMCSA
). At stake was British television company Sky (OTCMKTS:
SKYAY
). On the surface, you could understand the near-desperation with which the two media titans fought. Sky opens the door to the lucrative European TV market. Comcast, in particular, lost out to Disney over another protracted battle for Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:
FOXA
). Call it the male ego gone wild, but Comcast wasn't leaving this battlefield empty-handed. CMCSA shareholders, though, had a differing opinion. This is a huge, expensive bet that Comcast can turn itself around due to Sky. Subsequently, CMCSA dropped 6% on the announcement, while DIS stock gained slightly over 2%. The best part for DIS shareholders is that they know management has free reign to expand without an excessively onerous weight. Sky certainly offered benefits, but they also brought with them traditional-TV baggage.  Dividend Yield:  2.1% Thanks to a recent hissy fit with an iconic motorcycle manufacturer, President Trump is steadily running out of high-profile supporters. But one company stands in the batter's box that is safe from Trump's Twitter (NYSE:
TWTR
) outbursts: Boeing (NYSE:
BA
). Let's get the obvious out of the way: Boeing manufacturers the most important airplane in the world, Air Force One . While Trump shows no mercy when he's upset at something or someone, even he can't go toe-to-toe with BA. The optics of a President attacking Boeing just won't fly. More importantly, BA stock has proven relatively immune to the ongoing China tariffs. Despite the White House imposing broad-scale sanctions, the Chinese have been measured in their response. As a result, Boeing's management team forecasts continued growth in China despite obvious geopolitical challenges. They have a right to be confident. China has left open the door for large airplanes, signaling that they recognize BA quality. Thus, while Boeing's 2.1% yield isn't the most attractive for dividend stocks, it should prove incredibly safe.  Dividend Yield: 1.5% In terms of upside growth, I'm not a huge fan of Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
). Don't get this wrong: I'm in awe of what the late Steve Jobs has done in turning a garage-based company into a global behemoth. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that AAPL is still a consumer-electronics investment, which has pros and cons. The obvious benefit to owning AAPL is that today, it's the undisputed king. Everybody clamors for the latest iPhone or whatever gadget Apple is selling next. The company has also become a cultural phenomenon. That said, the inherent risk is that Apple becomes mired in a commoditized market . For instance, peak smartphone has become an increasingly painful reality. You can't really distinguish among devices nowadays, which hurts AAPL unless management can spark excitement again. But if your primary focus is buying safe dividend stocks, AAPL offers an excellent look. The company features strong earnings and predictable FCF, and sits on nearly $86.5 billion of cash.  Dividend Yield: 2.23% In my view, United Technologies (NYSE:
UTX
) offers a safe, predictable route to both upside gains and passive income. In the markets, UTX would fall under many conservative analysts' bag of stocks to buy. Primarily, United Technologies owns the Pratt & Whitney division that powers our most advanced warcraft. This comes in handy with our dealings with North Korea . Despite admittedly positive developments , we're still negotiating with a despot. History tells me that North Korea will break any peace agreement. This is why I stand with former President Theodore Roosevelt: speak softly and carry a big stick. For those who love safe dividend stocks, UTX offers a great look. The company has excellent financials, which includes steadily rising revenues and strong earnings. Additionally, I like the predictability of United Technologies' cash flow.  Dividend Yield: 2.2% Only in recent years have analysts considered retail plays as stocks to buy. And even then, they apply significant caution into the names they pick. Thanks to the emergence of e-commerce - and by e-commerce, I mean Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) - brick-and-mortars have struggled for traction and relevancy. But Walmart (NYSE:
WMT
) should emerge not only unscathed but vastly improved. Management looked at Amazon's success and began shoring up their own e-commerce channels. Despite being a retail fixture for decades, WMT is proving technologically adept. As an example, management is turning to the blockchain to help contain food poisoning. WMT also levers the substantial advantage of having a physical presence. No matter how great online shopping is, nothing beats going out to the store and attaining instant satisfaction. Plus, WMT sells everything, with some stores open 24 hours. In other words, WMT is one of the safest dividend stocks to buy because Amazon can't topple its moat.  Dividend Yield: 3% The pharmaceutical sector is always a tough business. Should a proposed drug fail to meet expectations during clinical trials, a lesser-financed outfit could quickly crumble. Add to this mix the political environment, and you have a combustible recipe. Still, I believe Amgen (NASDAQ:
AMGN
) offers a distinctive and positive approach to the sector. Unlike other pharma giants, AMGN focuses on a handful of therapies that work. Yes, nominally, they're very expensive. However, they're for extremely serious diseases and conditions, and are not taken frequently . As a result, AMGN stock is a decisive winner, having gained around 11% in the last year. Moreover, the company features enticing fundamental strengths. Amgen puts up consistently positive earnings, as well as predictable FCF. It also has over $29 billion in cash, providing confidence for its 3% dividend yield.  Dividend Yield: 2.5% Soft-drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:
KO
) has had a rough time  dealing with changing consumer habits. Americans, especially the younger demographic, eschew sugary beverages for healthier alternatives. Overall, I see Coca-Cola making the changes it needs to stay relevant in this ultra-competitive sector. However, I'm particularly intrigued with Coca-Cola European Partners (NYSE:
CCEP
). CCEP has shot up over 11% YTD. Coca-Cola's European bottler and distributor also pays out a fairly generous 2.5% dividend yield. While it has enjoyed a good year so far, CCEP has the goods to continue moving further down the road. While most people around the world are shifting towards healthy food and beverage options, the numbers speak the loudest. In western Europe, the market value of soft drinks have steadily risen over the past several years. That signals to me that CCEP benefits from a growing industry. Moreover, it has the fundamental stability to keep its attractive yield intact.  Dividend Yield: 2.77% Procter & Gamble (NYSE:
PG
) is a decidedly unsexy investment. A consumer-staples play, nobody really clamors to add PG stock to their portfolio. It's just there in case you need a usually dependable stock to protect yourself. In 2019, PG has gained 13.5%. Part of the recovery is likely due to its 2.77% dividend yield, which should prove very sustainable. For one thing, PG has an undeniable hold on consumer staples. No matter what, people have to buy things like soap, detergents and cold medicines. Second, the company has steadily grown its top and bottom lines, and it features robust FCF.  Dividend Yield: 2.9% J.M. Smucker (NYSE:
SJM
) earnings results have been mixed in recent years. However, one point to consider is its industry. As a popular food and beverage provider, the company's products will never go out of style. That provides a measure of reassurance, especially if the markets hit unforeseen headwinds. Furthermore, J.M. Smucker is one of the more generous safe dividend stocks to buy with a 2.9% yield. Thanks to relatively consistent earnings and positive FCF, investors can confidently rely on SJM.  Dividend Yield: 3.8% In 2018, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:
HOG
) experienced a double-whammy. As alluded to earlier, President Trump lashed out on HOG because management doesn't agree with his stance on tariffs. That opposition doesn't come as a surprise since HOG faces a demographic challenge. Not many young people desire Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which sounds almost sacrilegious. The other problem is that HOG has disappointed in the markets. On a 12-month basis, shares are down nearly 7%. With the ongoing China tariffs, Wall Street doesn't feel comfortable with the motorcycle manufacturer's growth prospects. But let's agive credit to management, which isn't taking consumer trends lying down. Instead, it's diving into relevant segments, such as committing to electric motorcycles . While it doesn't look great now, I think patient investors will be very happy with HOG in the future, and the 13% gain of HOG stock in 2019 shows that investors think it's on the right track.  Dividend Yield: 4% Usually, safe dividend stocks to buy offer limited passive income. That's basically how the free market works: if you want additional rewards, you must ramp up the risk. But for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:
XOM
), its 4% dividend yield is as good as gold. Actually, right now, it's better than gold for one simple reason: have you seen gas prices recently? You better believe that the current oil market has benefitted XOM stock. In 2019, shares are up almost 20%. Despite our greenbacks being generally stronger than other currencies, we're going to feel more pain at the pump. In addition to North Korea, Trump is taking on Iran. Through sanctions, he hopes to bring Iran to the negotiating table, with denuclearization an absolute must. The problem is that Iran exports two million barrels of crude oil daily. Undoubtedly, we can win a war of attrition with the Middle Eastern nation. However, it will cost us. Unless that is, you're a XOM shareholder.  Dividend Yield: 4.4% International Business Machines (NYSE:
IBM
) is another one of those dividend stocks that have tried investors' patience. Although it has earned a powerful reputation in the tech sector, many people regard IBM as a legacy company. But that doesn't mean this old dog is forever doomed to be irrelevant. Remember that tidbit earlier about Walmart using the blockchain to help eliminate food-poisoning cases? Well, the provider of the blockchain platform is none other than IBM. I believe it's incredibly significant that Walmart could have gone with any number of options. Instead, it went with IBM, not some upstart competitor promising much but delivering little. Plus, IBM has the foundational strength to support its 4.4% dividend yield.  It has consistently positive earnings, as well as reliable FCF. Finally, IBM is sitting on over $12 billion of cash.  Dividend Yield: 6.45% No one doubts that AT&T (NYSE:
T
) is a favorite among dividend stocks. The telecom giant currently offers nearly a 6.45% yield, which is better than some blue chips' equity-market returns. That said, analysts have debated whether or not T stock is worth its yield. Management has incurred significant debt to get to where it is. AT&T is exposed to disparate businesses, which has its own risks. But with the 5G rollout, I don't think you can afford to ignore T stock. Sure, rival Verizon Communications (NYSE:
VZ
) stole AT&T's thunder by becoming the world's first commercial 5G service provider. And I think VZ can do very well with their first-to-market advantage. However, AT&T is taking extra time to do things right, where they will roll out 5G using only standard equipment. Over the long run, the smart money favors T stock. As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. The post 15 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 appeared first on InvestorPlace .

1565," Not many years ago, Wall Street legend Warren Buffett described the airline industry as ""a death trap for investors."" Seems that times have changed. Now, he invests in many of them, and their business models look solid. On Wednesday, for example, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) -- the world's second-largest passenger airline -- reported its first-quarter results before the market opened, and there was plenty about them to like, including its best-ever top-line result. And investors looking elsewhere in the industry for good news were pleased by the rumors that popular budget carrier JetBlue (NASDAQ: JBLU)  was preparing to announce its first trans-Atlantic routes. In this MarketFoolery podcast, host Chris Hill and senior analyst Emily Flippen put the two airlines' situations in context for investors. And they check in on a strong player in a different, oft-troubled industry: Levi Strauss (NYSE: LEVI) . The jeans giant delivered its first post-IPO earnings report, and the results gave its stock another push into a valuation range that's rather rarified for a company in the apparel business. And they close with a discussion about a stock that Flippen is keeping an eye on now, as earnings season's about to get underway: software-as-a-service dynamo Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM) .

When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of April 1, 2019
The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.  This video was recorded on April 10, 2019. Chris Hill: It's Wednesday, April 10th. Welcome to MarketFoolery ! I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today, the one and only Emily Flippen. Thanks for being here! Emily Flippen:  Thanks for having me! Hill: Happy Wednesday! Flippen: [whispering] Happy Wednesday! Hill: [laughs] [whispers] Why are we whispering? Flippen: [laughs] Hump day! Hill: So, earnings season really starts to -- I don't want to say kick into high gear, but it definitely starts to heat up next week. But we do have some earnings this morning. We've got airlines. Amazingly, we have Levi Strauss reporting earnings. We'll get to that. Let's start with Delta, though. Delta Air Lines reported record revenue in the first quarter. Strong profits. They look like they're doing a good job on holding the line on expenses. You tell me, was there anything of note to be worried about with Delta? This looked like a really strong report. Flippen: Yeah, grea t report from Delta. Not completely unexpected, because last week they did raise revenue guidance, citing healthy demand. The company beat on both revenue and earnings, actually recognizing record-high revenue at $10.4 billion. But, that's still only about a 7.5% increase year over year, which is small, I think, for the economy that we're in right now, but significant for the airline industry as a whole. Delta shareholders are definitely happy today. There are a few things of note to me. The first was that part of their improved guidance was because oil prices weren't as high as they were expecting, which is really saying something. Oil prices have definitely shot up. It makes you wonder what Delta management was expecting here. Hill: Yeah, I saw that, too. I had the exact same reaction. It was like, ""Wait, how high were you expecting oil to go, that this is lower than what you were expecting?"" But, look, if they're being super conservative in terms of that what they think the price of oil is going to be, good for them. Again, they're doing a good job holding the line on expenses. That's obviously a huge expense for any airline. Flippen: It is. They also didn't have any of the 737 Max planes. A lot of that controversy that we saw earlier this quarter that affected a lot of other airlines, including American Airlines , Delta was relatively shielded from that. I don't think it makes a material difference, really, over the long term. But it's definitely helped over the short term. Hill: Yeah. I think we mentioned this on a previous episode, we always have expectations when we go into earnings season. Some of them have to do with the macroeconomic environment. Some of them are industry-specific. I think we said a couple of weeks ago on this show, expect absolutely every airline reporting earnings to either proactively talk about Boeing or immediately be asked on the conference call about Boeing. Flippen: Oh, of course. And I'll tell you what, it will be interesting to see if this changes the Buffett view about Delta at all. There's been a lot of word about whether or not Delta would be the next Buffett acquisition, a lot of controversy around that potential. It's a cyclical industry, but Delta is doing well. It's definitely one of the better-managed airlines. I'm interested to see if we see any Buffett buying in the future. Hill: We have one other airline to get to. But real quick, when you look at Delta's stock, it's not moving a whole lot today, but as you said, they had recently raised guidance. Year to date, it's up 14-15%. It's had a pretty decent lift recently. Does it look expensive to you? Flippen: It doesn't look expensive to me for the reports that we're seeing today. What does worry me is, like I mentioned before, this is a cyclical business. When times are good, times are good. But when times are bad, times are bad. The price that investors are willing to pay today is probably higher than the price that they're going to pay when the economy starts to contract. And that's a when, not an if. The rising price of oil does have me a little bit concerned. Who knows how long that will last? And, a general economic pullback will definitely hurt companies like Delta. Hill: JetBlue is going to report their earnings in two weeks, but shares of JetBlue are up about 4% this morning on reports that they're getting ready to announce the start of trans-Atlantic service. As someone who flies JetBlue a decent amount when I'm heading north -- it's very convenient to go from DCA up to Boston on JetBlue. I enjoy their service a great deal. I saw this report, and I just thought: ""OK, great! One more competitor in trans-Atlantic service? Yes, please!"" Flippen: JetBlue has been trying to do this for a while now. They've been talking about setting up trans-Atlantic service for years. It seems like it might be coming in the next couple of days, that announcement. I think the timing of it is really interesting, not only just because it's been so great for airlines recently, but also because we see a lot of competitors that are flying the trans-Atlantic routes get squeezed. Most recently, WOW Airlines, which is a discount Icelandic airline, went out of business. They shut down operations completely. They were mainly just a transit company, flying from the Southeast U.S. to key European cities. So, there's a competition that's decreasing in that area. Having a competitor like JetBlue come in means not only good things for JetBlue, but great things for consumers as well, because hopefully that means we'll be able to get cheaper flights here in the short term. Hill: Yeah. And for anyone who missed that story, that was both surprising and a little bizarre, when WOW shut down their airline. They did so very suddenly, and stranded a ton of people who were expecting to get on flights. If you've flown enough times, you've been in the situation where you're waiting at your gate and there's a delay or there's a maintenance issue, or maybe even your flight's been canceled. I've never been in position, ""We have some bad news, folks: The airline has completely gone out of business."" Flippen: I was having a conversation with David Gardner, actually, recently on a Rule Breaker Investing podcast -- Hill:  Name-dropper. Flippen:  [laughs] We talked about JetBlue. He quizzed me over the market cap. I had no idea about the size of JetBlue. I guessed it had a $1.5 billion market cap. That is horribly under what JetBlue's market cap is. And he said to me, ""I hope you're never flying an airline that has a $1.5 billion market cap."" And I immediately thought to myself, ""Well, I just got back from a trip right through WOW and Wizz Air , both of which I expect to have market caps probably around that size."" So, it was interesting to me. If you do see airlines go out a business, especially in troubled times, having issues with oil prices or controversies around airplanes, it's these smaller companies that are the ones that are taking the brunt of the force. Hill: Just a few weeks ago, Levi Strauss went public. This morning, Levi's came out with their firs t earnings report. First-quarter revenue came in 7% higher than a year ago. You looked at the report, what'd you think? Flippen:  I was surprised, I'm not going to lie. I was a little bit skeptical when Levi's went public. I immediately thought, this is going to be a short-term pop situation, and then people are going to remember that they sell jeans. Hill: [laughs] They're not bad! Flippen: They're not bad jeans, not at all. And it's not a poorly managed company at all. But ultimately, they're still a clothing retailer. We've seen the market really punish these types of businesses over the past few years. So, 7% revenue growth was much better than I personally expected. The company reiterated their previous guidance. But if I'm honest, I'm still not excited about 7% revenue growth. Maybe that's because I invest more in high-growth companies. But at the price that they're trading at today, it's clear that people expect great things from Levi's. That's not to say that they won't be able to deliver on them. Because 7% revenue growth, like I said, for this industry, is amazing. But it is to say that the expectations are high. There's not a lot of room for Levi's to trip up here. Hill: Let's go back to market caps for a second. JetBlue has a market cap of around $5 billion. Levi's goes public at $17 a share on opening day, it pops to $22. It's up a little bit on this report. I think now it's $23 a share. It has a market cap of $9 billion. And that's the thing that I focus on when I look at this. Again, they make a good product. They do a good job managing this business. It's hard for me to say that I really like this stock where it is because I look at them and just think, ""You've just come public, it's a $9 billion valuation, which really seems pricey to me."" This is absolutely an example of, I want to see a couple of more quarters of them in the public markets before I put this stock on my watchlist. Flippen: Exactly. I'd want to see their ability to continue to deliver on those types of numbers. Right now, they're trading for a price of sales of about 7 times. Essentially, if you buy the stock today, you're paying a price that is 7 times the sales per share that the company has. That's significant because the average in the industry is less than 1 for clothing retailers. That's not to say, like I said, that Levi's is average. Admittedly, it's probably a company that does deserve a bit of a premium. If any clothier has growth ahead of it, it's Levi's. But it's not to say that it's a cheap company at this point. Hill: Well, and you look at the apparel retail space, pretty much every company at some point in time has put together a good 12 months. And by a good 12 months, I mean a 12-month span where shareholders were rewarded. Whatever the long-term performance of companies like Gap or American Eagle or Abercrombie & Fitch , you can find a one-year period where, boy, that was a great time to own that stock. But over the long term, it's a really tough business. It's hard to feel like any of those stocks are ones that you would not have on a short leash. Flippen: Yeah, exactly. But every single time I've made that comment, those companies have turned around and performed wonderfully. So I've become a little bit hesitant in feeling confident about the cyclicality of certain industries, retail being one of them. Hill: Two quick things before we wrap up today. One, it was this day four years ago, 2015 -- and by this day, I don't mean the 10th. I mean the day before the Masters tournament started, that Jason Moser was on the show. Those who know Jason know that he's a great analyst, a great host of Industry Focus , and he's a golf nut. So, four years ago, I said, ""Who should I be watching in the Masters?"" And he said: ""Jordan Spieth. That's the guy. That's the guy I'm watching."" And sure enough, Jordan Spieth went on to win the Masters that year. So I just pinged Jason on Slack. I said, ""Hey, I know you're not in the studio today, but just give me something."" He said: ""Rory McIlroy. This is the year that Rory McIlroy is going to get it done."" So, for the golf fans out there, there you go. There's a little something from Jason Moser. As I mentioned, earnings season starts to heat up next week. It's also spring break, so I'm not going to be here. I'll be in Santa Fe, New Mexico. But don't worry. Mac Greer is going to take good care of the dozens of listeners. What are you watching this earnings season? I always like to go into earnings season with several ideas in mind. One of them is always, what's the company or the industry that I'm the most curious about? And by that I mean, I want to see what they do, because I'm not really sure what they're going to do. Flippen: Next week, we have some big names reporting like Netflix and Intuitive Surgical . But the company that I'm actually the most excited about is a company called Atlassian. Maybe that's not exactly a household name for people who don't spend all their time looking at SaaS companies. But Atlassian is a software provider of collaboration improvement services, you could say. They make products like Jira and Trello. What's really interesting is that we've seen, like you said, this entire industry of SaaS companies posting amazing growth. 2018 was an extremely impressive year for a lot of the software companies. 2019, I think it's going to be interesting to see if these companies can keep up the importance of the software that they're providing, or if they're maybe just a short-term fad within companies. I'm excited to see what they report. Expectations, again, are high. I think they're expecting a revenue increase of about 36%, which is down from 40% last quarter, but not down a lot. 36%, like I said, is significant, especially when you're comparing to something like Levi's, at 7%. But, they're still losing money. These companies, it's fun to watch the earnings report because they're growing so well, they're so well run, so well managed, doing great things, but not posting at least not accounting profits. So, I keep my eye on them. At some point, those tides are going to change. Hill: And this is not ever a reason to buy a stock. But Atlassian does have one of the more fun ticker symbols. Flippen: It does, TEAM. Hill: Emily Flippen, thanks for being here! Flippen: Thanks for having me!

1566," Software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) just put a date to its fiscal third-quarter earnings report; the company will release results for the period on April 24. Given the stock's 18% year-to-date rise, investors will undoubtedly be watching the update closely. The company has been seeing strong top- and bottom-line growth recently, helped by impressive momentum in its commercial cloud revenue -- a revenue category composed of three of the company's most powerful catalysts. Can Microsoft keep up its strong growth? Ahead of Microsoft's earnings release later this month, here's a preview of some key areas for investors to watch.  Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft's fiscal second-quarter revenue of $32.47 billion was up 12% year over year but was slightly below analysts' consensus forecast for revenue of $32.51 billion. The top-line miss may have investors watching the company's revenue growth more closely when the tech gian t report s its fiscal third-quarter results. In constant currency, Microsoft's fiscal second-quarter revenue increased 13% year over year. On average, analysts are expecting Microsoft to post fiscal third-quarter revenue of $29.8 billion, up 11.3% year over year. Microsoft's non- GAAP earnings per share (EPS) managed to barely beat analysts' average estimate in fiscal Q2. Non-GAAP EPS for the period was $1.10, up from $0.96 in the year-ago quarter. On average, analysts expected non-GAAP EPS of $1.09. Notably, Microsoft's profitability is trending better than it appears on the surface. In constant currency, non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal Q2 increased 15% year over year. For Microsoft's fiscal third quarter, analysts expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.00, up from $0.95 in the year-ago quarter. A key driver for Microsoft's revenue growth in fiscal Q2 was the company's commercial cloud revenue, composed of revenue from Office 365 commercial, Azure, and Dynamics 365 -- products that are central to Microsoft's ongoing transition to a cloud-based business model. Commercial cloud revenue increased 48% year over year in fiscal Q2 to $9 billion. This marked an acceleration over Microsoft's 47% year-over-year growth in commercial cloud revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The segment's growth during fiscal Q2 was ""anchored by Azure [year-over-year] revenue growth of 76%,"" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings call . Investors should look for similar growth in commercial cloud revenue in fiscal Q3, as Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted in the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings call that she expects ""continued strong performance in our commercial cloud business."" Microsoft will report its fiscal third-quarter results after market close on Wednesday, April 24.  10 stocks we like better than Microsoft

1567," Rite Aid (NYSE: RAD) had a good start to 2019, but the stock has been spiraling downward since late January. The pharmacy retailer's share price is now down more than 20% this year. Investors were eager to find out if Rite Aid could begin to turn things around in the company's quarterly update. Rite Aid announced its fiscal fourth-quarter results for the period ending March 2, 2019, before the market opened on Thursday. Here are the highlights.  Image source: Getty Images. Rite Aid reported revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of $5.38 billion, just a little below the prior year's Q4 revenue of $5.39 billion. Analysts had estimated that the company would earn $5.56 billion. The company announced fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $134.1 million, which was around 2.5% of total revenue. In the same period of the previous year, the company's adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $154.8 million, or 2.9% of revenue. Rite Aid's GAAP net loss from continuing operations for Q4 was $255.6 million, or $0.24 per share. This reflected an improvement from the prior-year period net loss from continuing operations of $483.7 million, or $0.46 per share. The pharmacy chain also reported an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $13.3 million, or $0.01 per share. This figure was considerably worse than the adjusted net loss in the year-ago period of $7.8 million, or $0.01 per share. It was better than the $0.02-per-share adjusted net loss expected by analysts. Rite Aid CEO John Standley emphasized the positives. He stated, ""In the fourth quarter, we continued generating critical momentum in key areas of our business while taking important steps to position Rite Aid for future growth."" Standley added, ""Despite a mild flu season, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of same-store pharmacy sales and prescription growth thanks to a record number of immunizations and other script growth initiatives."" However, there were plenty of negatives. Rite Aid's pharmacy sales were adversely impacted by new generic introductions. Its bottom-line improvement stemmed mainly from the positive impact of a prior-year charge for the impairment of goodwill of $191.0 million, net of tax, and lower income tax expense. Rite Aid also posted a decline in front-end same-store sales and higher distribution costs. The company has taken some steps that could impact future performance. Rite Aid remodeled 30 stores. This brought the total number of wellness stores to 1,765. The pharmacy retailer also closed 56 stores, leaving a total store count of 2,469 at the end of Q4. Standley said that the continued transformation of Rite Aid's business ""to better align with our new operational footprint and deliver greater value"" would help build momentum in the coming year. Perhaps the worst news from Rite Aid's update was the company's outlook for fiscal 2020. Rite Aid forecast revenue between $21.5 billion and $21.9 billion. However, analysts expected $22.09 billion. Rite Aid thinks that it could report net income in fiscal 2020 of as much as $0.04 per share. However, the low end of the company's projection is a net loss of $0.01 per share. Analysts predicted $0.02 per share in adjusted earnings for the year. The reality is that Rite Aid continues to face significant issues. The reimbursement environment in the U.S. is challenging. Rite Aid isn't likely to be able to offset reimbursement declines with lower generic drug prices at this point. Investors can probably expect more uncertainty for the struggling pharmacy retailer in future quarters.  10 stocks we like better than Rite Aid

1568," Some investors might be reluctant to buy stocks in the bull market's 10th year due to concerns about valuations. However, plenty of high-quality stocks still trade at absurdly low valuations, and patient investors who buy them today might reap big profits over the long term. Today, a trio of our Motley Fool contributors will highlight three value plays in an aging bull market: Macy's (NYSE: M) , General Mills (NYSE: GIS) , and Markel (NYSE: MKL) . Leo Sun (Macy's): Macy's lost about a quarter of its value over the past six months as its comparable-store sales decelerated and its gross margin contracted annually and sequentially during the crucial holiday quarter. However, that sell-off reduced Macy's forward P/E to 8, and it pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 6.1%.  Image source: Macy's. Macy's has been gradually closing stores over the past two years, selling its prime real estate and leasing it back to cut costs, and expanding its e-commerce ecosystem with a wider range of products and faster delivery options. But despite those efforts, Wall Street expects Macy's revenue to stay flat this fiscal year (which started on Feb. 2) as its earnings tumble 26%. The main problem is that the expansion of Macy's loyalty and e-commerce platforms are weighing down its near-term margins. Loyalty members get exclusive discounts, and its digital sales generate lower margins due to fulfillment expenses. Macy's also doesn't have much room to raise prices, since it aggressively competes with Amazon.com and Walmart . Macy's turnaround isn't as aggressive as Walmart's, but it's still generating flat to slightly positive comps growth, and it still has other irons in the fire. Its Macy's Backstage off-price stores and Bluemercury beauty product stores are generating robust sales growth, it's shrinking down its massive stores, and its recent introduction of ""narrative-driven"" Story marketplaces (which feature community events and do-it-yourself stations from a wide range of brands) could bring shoppers back to its brick-and-mortar stores. These catalysts could enable Macy's to eventually mount a comeback, so investors who buy shares today could be well rewarded over the next few years. Reuben Gregg Brewer (General Mills): It might be a stretch to suggest that packaged food giant General Mills is absurdly cheap after a 30% stock price advance so far in 2019. But it's still trading below its five-year averages for price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, price-to-cash flow, and price-to-book value. The discounts on each vary, but the total sum of that information is that the stock still looks cheap today. Where it gets a little more exciting is the 3.8% dividend yield, which is toward the upper end of the company's historical range.  GIS dividend yield (TTM) data by YCharts . There are two questions to look at from here: First, why is the stock relatively cheap today? The answer is that customers are shifting their buying habits and it's taken General Mills some time to catch up. And doing so has been something of a chore, involving shedding noncore assets (Green Giant), upgrading existing products (Yoplait yogurt), and buying new brands (Annie's and Blue Buffalo). The recent Blue Buffalo purchase was a particular issue because it was an expensive transaction , leading to a troubling rise in debt. Second, why the rally? The company's turnaround efforts appear to be taking hold . There's more work to be done, as management readily admitted on its fiscal third-quarter conference call , but it was able to tout a leadership position in cereal, larger market share in yogurt, and continued success in increasing the reach of Blue Buffalo. And the company has reduced long-term debt by roughly $1 billion (8%) over the last four quarters. In other words, all of Mr. Market's concerns appear to be working out for the best. As long as that keeps happening, General Mills looks enticingly cheap even after a big rally.  Image source: Getty Images. Steve Symington (Markel): Markel shares have plunged around 20% since hitting their all-time high last fall, driven by a combination of the broader market's pullback in December with an ugly quarterly report from the specialty insurance and financial holding company two months ago. But as I noted shortly after tha t report in February, Markel's quarter wasn't nearly as bad as it looked on the surface. While it incurred an comprehensive loss to shareholders of $680.4 million during the quarter, for example -- and keeping in mind that broader-market pullback -- those losses stemmed from declines in the fair value of stocks held in the company's enviable, long-term-oriented investment portfolio. During the subsequent conference call , co-CEO Tom Gayner noted the company's equity investments indeed lost 3.5% over the course of 2018. But that's hardly indicative of their long-term performance, as the equity portfolio has still achieved annualized gains of 9.7% over the past five years. ""Obviously, I'm not thrilled to report negative returns to you for 2018,"" Gayner added. ""But I do see them as reflecting normal and expected volatility that is the very warp and woof of financial markets. Fortunately, this is nothing new for us."" Meanwhile, as Markel patiently waits for the stock market to improve -- as it certainly has done so far in 2019 -- the company can lean on the relative strength of its insurance operations and its diversified group of acquired businesses under the Markel Ventures segment. For investors who recognize that Market's recent results don't reflect the underlying strength of its business model, and with shares trading at a reasonable 1.49 times book value as of this writing, I think now is a great time to open or add to a position.  10 stocks we like better than General Mills

1569,"The greenback remained sustained with a sideways pattern during the Asian trading session in the range of 96.90/95 levels. The US Dollar Index had shot straight up on the release of multiple higher than expected US reports. The US March Producer Price Index (PPI) reported 0.3 percent above the market expectation. The MoM reports for the US March PPI figures excluding Food and Energy revealed 0.1 percent above the street estimates. Both Initial Jobless Claims computed since April 9, and Continuing Jobless Claims calculated since March 29 reported lower than the analyst anticipation provided an extra boost to the already rising US Dollar Index. The DXY had touched the strong resistance of 97.19 level making it the day's high at 17:58 GMT. After plunging continuously for three days in a row, the safe-haven pair was 0.44 percent today. The USD/JPY pair opened up on Thursday morning near 111.01 level. The pair later on slowly kept climbing the chart knocking off the strong 111.53 resistance level. The main pushing force behind the yen pair was the uplifting US Dollar Index. The greenback computed against the six major rival currencies went above the 97.00 level rebounding last day's losses. The USD Index had risen underpinned strong US Producer Price Index (PPI), and Jobless claims figures. Along with these positive reports, the 10-year T-bond went 0.75 percent up adding fuel to the pair's upward rally. The Euro pair remained in the consolidation phase near 1.1276 level during the early Asian trading session. German March Consumer Price Index (Both YoY & MoM) reported in-line with the respective consensus estimates. However, the EUR/USD faced steep falls reaching day's fresh low near 1.1254 levels. The greenback soared amid positive reports touching new highs pushing down the most prominent rival euro and thereby generating strong pullbacks for the EUR/USD . Earlier the day, ECB President Mario Draghi and ECB Governing Council member & Bank of France Head Villeroy had mentioned their dovish stance regarding eurozone economic slowdown. The GBP/USD rang the opening bell on Thursday morning near 1.3094 levels. It saw some slight upward initially but failed to keep up the hold dropping near the lower vicinity marking fresh low for the day at 1.3057 level. The previous day, the EU had granted the UK with an additional Brexit extension until October 31. This time, the extension is a bit ""flexible"" one which means the UK can leave at any point within the deadline after ratifying a proper deal with the EU. But, the cable bulls remained silent despite such a flexible Brexit extension. The cable also falls prey to the rising greenback. The Pound pair slumped after the release of above the expected US PPI figures and lowest Jobless claims recorded since 1969. The Aussie pair started the morning session near 0.7169 level and was pushed off the cliff making it land somewhere near the lower vicinity of 0.7120 level. The continuous tumbling in the AUD/USD was backed obviously on the strengthening US Dollar Index. The US had released some splendid report numbers which brought forth the deepened plunge in the significant rival currencies weighed against the greenback.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including McDonald's (MCD), Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) and Charles Schwab (SCHW). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see
all of today's research reports here >>> McDonald's shares have gained +17.1% in the past year, underperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry which has gained +19.4% over the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks high labor costs and currency headwinds remain major concerns. Moreover, revenues have been under pressure for quite some time due to strategic refranchising initiatives. Even its heightened focus on refranchising might cut the capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth. McDonald's margins have been under pressure from worldwide wage increases. However, McDonald's impressive earnings surprise history, various sales and digital initiatives, as well as positive comparable sales, bode well. In fact, global comps at McDonald's have been positive over the trailing 14 quarters. Furthermore, increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should boost its performance. These apart, efforts to drive growth in International Lead & High Growth Markets bode well. (You can

). Shares of Buy-ranked Enterprise Products have gained +6.9% over the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Oil Production Pipeline MLP industry's increase of +5.4%. The Zacks analyst likes Enterprise Products' extensive network of pipelines that is spread across nearly 50,000 miles. Importantly, the pipeline network, which is connected to every major U.S. shale play, provides services to producers and users of commodities by transporting gas, liquids, and refined products. At present, Enterprise's $5.1-billion pipeline of fee-oriented midstream projects positions it to enjoy above-average growth in distributable cash flow over the next two years, in turn expanding its distribution coverage ratio. Most importantly, its ethane export facilities in the Gulf Coast, which link domestic producers to the overseas market, should drive further growth as the use of ethane is rapidly increasing to manufacture plastic instead of naphtha. As such, the partnership holds tremendous upside potential. (You can

). Schwab shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the past year, declining -14.5% vs. -19.4%. The Zacks analyst likes Schwab's impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters. Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company's first quarter 2019 earnings release. The company remains well positioned to gain from the higher interest rates and its initiatives to strengthen trading income. Also, the company's efforts to improve operating efficiency will go a long way to support profitability. Its efficient capital deployment activities reflect a strong balance sheet position. However, continuously rising operating expenses are likely to hurt bottom-line growth to an extent. Moreover, the company's significant dependence on fee-based revenues remains a major concern as it might hamper financials. (You can

1571," Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and ""initiate coverage"" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) investors just can't seem to catch a break. Since rebounding off their lows from the great tech sell-off of 2018, Tesla shares have been in free fall -- down more than $100 (or 29%) since about mid-December on manifold bad news headlines. Last week, the stock suffered from news that Model 3 sedan production was stalling and Model 3 deliveries were falling . Today, shares are getting hit by reports that Tesla has decided to cut electric battery production in line with stagnant electric car sales. Here's what you need to know.  Tesla's plans to produce cheap batteries en masse at its Gigafactory aren't working out quite as expected. Image source: Tesla . This morning, TheFly.com cites a report from Nikkei Asian Review warning that Tesla and Gigafactory partner Panasonic are putting on hold plans to expand Gigafactory 1 battery production by 50%. Within this mammoth, 15 million-square-foot Nevada factory, Panasonic builds rechargeable electric car batteries, and Tesla assembles them into battery packs for its cars -- among them the Model 3. But with Model 3 sales leveling off, the case for making additional investment in expanding production capacity has weakened, and Nikkei Asian Review says the companies have been forced to rethink their plans. Adding to the worries, there are rumors that Panasonic may also be having doubts about the companies' planned, jointly operated Shanghai, China, Gigafactory. It didn't take Wall Street long to react to the Nikkei report. This morning, analysts at Roth Capital cut their price target on Tesla from $270 to $240 a share. Despite the fact that Roth maintains a neutral rating on the stock, the new target -- implying a 10% downside risk -- suggests that Roth is actually more pessimistic about Tesla's chances than its rating lets on. Roth wasn't coy about its reasons for cutting its price target, either. Directly referencing the story in Nikkei , the analyst noted: ""The direct read on Panasonic/Tesla suspending plans for Gigafactory expansion is the partners probably do not see Tesla achieving projected sales volumes, and therefore necessary battery demand."" The analyst then went a step further, though, in a note covered by StreetInsider.com  (subscription required), blaming ""too high"" battery costs at Tesla for the failure of its Model 3 to sustain sales growth. Roth notes that Tesla powercells probably cost about $240 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which means that the 62 kWh battery pack in a midrange Model 3 adds nearly $15,000 to the car's cost. A long-range battery pack, rated at 74 kWh, would add nearly $18,000. Granted, other automakers entering the electric car race face even higher costs. (The analyst notes that Volkswagen , for example, is probably paying about $250/kWh.) But even so, the upshot is that the vast scale of Tesla/Panasonic's Gigafactory doesn't appear to be translating into significant reductions in battery cost. Or as Roth puts it: ""Tesla has no advantage here."" That's a frighteningly blunt statement for Tesla investors, given how much faith has been invested in the company's efforts to gain scale in battery production, with the goal of lowering battery costs and underpricing its competitors. But the numbers seem to bear it out. Currently, S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows that Tesla's gross profit margin of 18.8% is precisely equal to Volkswagen's 18.8% gross margin -- while Volkswagen's operating and net margins for last year were positive. (Tesla's weren't, although it did score positive profit margin in the year's second half.) Now, it's still possible that Roth is too negative on Tesla and is prejudging the company's performance too soon. Tesla is only just now getting up to speed on Model 3 production, after all, and isn't yet reaping the full economies of scale that it might eventually expect to gain from all-out production rates at its soon-to-be-multiple Gigafactories. Furthermore, there's a movement afoot in Congress to double the number of electric cars per manufacturer eligible for federal $7,500 income tax credits. If that initiative bears fruit, it could well goose Tesla's sales growth once again, spur demand for additional production, and support demand for Gigafactory batteries -- perhaps leading to reductions in battery cost. For now, however, it's fear of renewed losses for Tesla that's winning the day over greed in anticipation of greater Tesla sales -- and Tesla stock is going down.  10 stocks we like better than Tesla

1574," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips I am not a fan of writing about downside potential, but there is temporary risk to Delta Air Lines (NYSE:
DAL
) stock up here. Before you label me a hater, today's write up is not a diss about the company itself or its prospects. This is merely a call for caution that is more technically based than fundamental.  Yesterday, DAL stock reported a strong earnings report and the stock appropriately rallied on the headline. The stock so far is trading in lock step with the S&P 500 as it nears its all-time highs from November. Year-to-date, DAL stock is up a respectable 17%. Fundamentally, the company seems to be doing great, and they promised even better things to come as they raised their forward guidance for 2019. Yet, the stock is cheap, as it only sells at a 8x forward price to earnings ratio. And it also pays a 2.4% dividend to sweeten the pot. So why am I cautious about the stock up here? There are some worrisome technical aspects to consider. Although it ended yesterday up, the 3% spike faded in spite of the awesome report. Their management media appearance sounded super confident yet it couldn't retain its highs of the day. This by itself is not a deal killer, but there is more. Recently, Delta stock broke out from $52 per share in a big way. So the fast rise in the stock left big open gaps below that could become magnets for short-term trading. While not every gap on a chart gets filled, most of them do. This one is prominent enough that it will attract attention from short sellers. If DAL loses $56.50 per share, it could invite momentum sellers to try and target $53 per share. While this is not a forecast, it is a scenario prospective buyers of the stock should know. Wall Street analysts who cover the stock are almost unanimous in rating DAL stock a buy. This leaves no room for improvement and increases the odds of a surprise downgrade. I get uncomfortable when everyone agrees on the same thing because this is when change usually comes. Again, this is not an imminent threat, but it's looming. In fact, just this week, Credit Suisse raised its price target on Delta - and it probably won't be the only one to do so.  We also have outside factors meddling with the airline stocks. This time, it's about Boeing (NYSE:
BA
). The grounding of the 737 Max and its production halt has a big impact on airlines. Delta has none of those, so it won't benefit from a relief pop once that situation is resolved. So DAL stock could lose bids to other airlines who are currently under pressure from BA's woes. In summary, although I like what the Delta team is doing and how strong the stock it, this is not an obvious time to initiate a new long position. Long term, this is not a worry, so those long it already with profits can stay in them and manage those positions according to their parameters. After all, when management tells us that demand for Delta's products has never been stronger, we believe them. This is the ultimate statement of confidence that they are executing well on their plans. Otherwise they'd be offering excuses to explain away what's not working.

1575," Of all the int erviews I've published, my first interview with Sean Stannard-Stockton , the president and chief investment officer at Ensemble Capital, was one of the most widely read. And rightly so! Sean is wicked smart, has a learning mindset, and is a great investor and investing teacher. To see what I mean, check out Sean's blog, Intrinsic Investing , or his recent presentation on Sensata  Technologies  for the MOI 2019 Best Ideas Conference . In that first interview, we discussed Sean's investing philosophy and process. We discussed legacy moats, reinvestment moats, and capital-light compounder moats. We also discussed incremental returns on tangible invested capital , distributable cash flow, discounted cash flow  valuation , and so much more.  Ferraris are one example of ""Giffen goods,"" or those whose demand increases when the price increases. Image source: Getty Images. Today, we discuss Sean's qualitative checklist  and why he avoids adhering too closely  to most quantitative metrics  in his search for idiosyncratic businesses . We also chat about  asset turnover as a driver of return s  on invested capital, free cash flow yield as a valuation tool,  and the concept of stall speed. We talk about Giffen  goods. We even discuss body mass index. There's an excellent lesson there -- you'll see! Every time I chat with Sean, I'm wowed not just by his knowledge, but by his ability to share that knowledge  in an easy-to-understand way. Oh yeah. In this interview, w e also talk stocks . Awesome stocks! We discuss several companies that I think deserve more attention, including Ferrari N.V. (NYSE: RACE) , Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE: BR) , First American Financial (NYSE: FAF) , and Landstar System (NASDAQ: LSTR) . And we go deep into Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX)  and explore the valuation of both Mastercard (NYSE: MA) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) . Here we go ... John Rotonti : It's been almost two years since our last interview. Can you remind us what investment criteria (or qualities) you look for when analyzing businesses? Sean Stannard-Stockton :  We have three general sets of criteria that we use as a lens for analysis of every company we own. Most importantly ,  we are looking for competitively advantaged businesses that we think will see those advantages persist and which offer products or services that will remain in demand over the very long term. We believe this requirement eliminates approximately 70% of publicly traded companies from consideration. Then we look at management behavior on two key issues: one, the management team's track record of creating economic value and our assessment of their ability to continue to do this well into the future, and two, the management team's track record on capital allocation and the degree to which we trust them to continue to allocate capital in the best interest of shareholders. We place just as much weight on the decision-making  process the management team uses for both. So,  a poorly time d  stock buyback, for instance, doesn't concern us so long as we believe that at the time the company made the decision and based on the information they had at that time, that they were making an intelligent  decision. Finally, we assess our own ability to make relatively accurate forecasts about the future of the business. This analysis is partly driven by the intrinsic ""forecastability"" of the business (for instance, even oil industry CEOs can't forecast the price of oil, while an expert on consumer packaged  goods can forecast price trends quite accurately to within 1% or so of what actually occurs), as well as our team ' s ability to understand the business in question. As a team of generalists, we are comfortable investing across a range of industries. But there are some businesses that are better suited to our specific expertise, while we will pass on an investment if we believe that our own circle of competency is not well aligned with the company in question. Rotonti : Do you codify these criteria into a formal investing checklist? In other words, does Ensemble Capital put each company through an investing checklist before deciding to buy stock in that business? Stannard-Stockton :  Yes, although the checklist is a list of qualitative assessments rather than quantitative checkboxes. We think that idiosyncratic businesses  that don't fit typical quantitative checklists are actually some of the most fertile hunting grounds for alpha. But we have a rigorous check list related to the criteria I described earlier,  and we convert these qualitative assessments into quantitative rankings that play a direct role in determining which companies we invest in and the position size we will hold. Rotonti : You recently published one of the best investing articles I've read in a very long time, titled "" The Risk of Low-Growth Stocks ."" I think it should be required reading for investors!  Can you please summarize your main point ,  and explain the formula  "" Free cash flow yield + expected growth = A rough estimate of expected annual rate of return ""? Stannard-Stockton :  That's nice of you to say, John. That article had a couple of key points. First of all ,  we described how most people focus on the risk of high-growth stocks, but a key risk to a stock ' s valuation is its terminal growth rate. Even small changes in the long-term  growth rate of a business greatly affect its value. So,  the article detailed how, for instance ,  consumer packaged goods  companies seeing their historical 5% or so growth rates slowing to 3% or so w ould drive a downward revision of their intrinsic value of 30% or more.

While this isn't an entirely new idea for us, it is something we  have  focused on more in recent years as this risk cropped up in a couple of our holdings; for one, Prestige Brands , we wrote a case study  about what went wrong. The element of this analysis that I think we have come to better appreciate is the concept of stall speed: the idea that companies, much like biological organisms and ecosystems, rarely remain in a state of equilibrium. Instead ,  most living things (and companies are just collections of people) are either growing or declining. Or ,  as William S. Burroughs put it, ""When you stop growing, you start dying.""  We're big fans of cross-disciplinary thinking, and so I'd note that Albert Einstein was touching on a similar concept when he said, ""Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving."" The math is really quite  simple. The Gordon Growth Model, probably the most basic valuation model, shows that a series of cash flows is worth your initial cash yield plus the growth rate of the cash flows. So ,  if you pay $100 for a cash flow stream that starts at $ 4  ( 4 %) and grows at 5 % a year, you'll earn a 9% ( 4 % plus 5 %) rate of return. Since the Gordon Growth Model only holds in a case where the growth rate is perpetual and there is no volatility, it isn't very useful for directly valuing stocks. But it does make clear how to value a company in a theoretical terminal state. Historically, the stock market has offered a 4% cash-flow yield, and cash flows have grown by about 5% a year. That's why the stock market has historically offered an average annual return of 9%.  But as we described in the article, if a company's growth slows to 3% or 1%, then  the cash-flow yield needs to spike higher, to 6% or 8%, in order for  investors to earn 9% going forward. This spike in cash-flow yields is achieved by a sharp decline in the stock price, and that's the risk we tried to highlight in our article. Rotonti : The last time we spoke, you said that most of your portfolio holding s  were growing faster  than GDP, but that GDP-plus growth was not a requirement. Is this still the case, or do you now require that all of  your new investments be growing the top and bottom line at a certain rate? Stannard-Stockton :  We actually have  very few quantitative requirements for companies to enter our portfolio. While many quantitative requirements, such as a minimum growth rate, a maximum debt level, or the existence of a dividend payment, might be good rules in general, we are looking to assemble a focused portfolio of outstanding companies, not pass judgement on all companies. So  we have high standards related to the ongoing relevance of a company's products and services, the management team ' s prudent use of debt, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation decisions, but we don't attempt to distill our judgement on these matters down to a simplistic, quantitative rule. In fact, we think doing so is dangerous, because we know that any alpha-generating factor that can be quantified into a simple rule will quickly have that alpha captured by massively resourced quantitative trading algorithms. So ,  we're far more interested in idiosyncratic businesses  that may break some well-intentioned quantitative  rules but which actually do meet the qualitative meaning that those rules are attempting to capture. I think this focus on qualitative meaning over quantitative measure gets at the heart of how we generate alpha . Some people might push back on this concept because they rightly assert that simple quantitative rules have often been shown to outperform even expert-level qualitative judgement. But it is important to recognize that we are still monitoring many quantitative metrics -- we just do not blindly follow them, but instead seek to get at the qualitative meaning that those rules are trying to capture. A quick example. A person's body mass index (BMI), a weight-to-height ratio  that is calculated by dividing a person's weight by their  height , is a reasonably good indicator of obesity. In general,  it is perfectly accurate to decide that anyone with an BMI over 30 is obese. But guess who else tends to have BMIs over 30? Professional athletes. While the average person with a BMI of over 30 is quite likely to be unhealthy, you can also get to a BMI of over 30 by having professional-athlete levels of muscle mass.  But the qualitative meaning behind the BMI index is about health. So,  while we don't set a quantitative rule like ""BMI must be under 30""  as part of our process,  we do set qualitative rules like ""people who are extremely healthy and fit,"" and we of course may consider a BMI score as part of our health assessment. But we make sure to never mistake the quantitative measure for the qualitative meaning that we're seeking. G etting back to your original question, yes, it is still the case that we do not have a requirement that a company's growth rate must be GDP-plus. But we have always been focused on seeking out companies that will have robust and resilient profit streams over long periods, and in recent years we have become even more aware of the risks associated with sub-GDP-growing businesses and how these companies have a tendency of hitting a ""stall speed"" in which they go into a downward spiral. Rotonti : Ferrari N.V.  is the largest holding in the Ensemble Fund. What is your investment thesis on Ferrari? Stannard-Stockton : Ferrari sells cars,  so a lot of people assume it is a car company. It is  not. It's a luxury goods company. Sometimes people use that type of categorization comment to justify a high valuation, but what I mean is that Ferrari's financial statements look and behave like [those of] a high-end  luxury company, not a car company. Profit margins are fantastic, returns on capital are sky-high. Pricing power is amazing. Demand is not very cyclical.  Because of the long wait list to buy a Ferrari, even during recessions the company sees steady demand. The fact is if you have enough money to buy a Ferrari, then a recession isn't going to change your mind. As an example, when we  went to Italy  last year  for Ferrari's  Capital Markets Day, the company was announcing the launch of their new, limited-edition (499 units) Monza supercar. They told potential customers that it would cost between $1 million and $2 million, and on that basis, they sold out. Only after they had sold out did they announce the price ($1.85 million) . Despite the huge demand, the company refused to allow any buyer to purchase more than one  car. They even referred to those customers selected to have the privilege of purchasing a Monza  as the ""lucky few."" We  met one of these buyers at the event and it would be fair to describe  him as "" giddy with excitement. "" This consumer behavior bears no relation to how people buy ""cars."" It is more accurate to say that what Ferrari actually sells  is membership into one of the most exclusive global clubs  for the ultra-wealthy . Membership in this club is such a big deal that a Ferrari owner who was refused the chance to buy the LaFerrari  Spider  supercar actually sued the company, saying that his inability to buy the car harm ed  hi s  reputation and held  him up to ridicule, disrespect, and disrepute among his friends and business associates. A "" G iffen  good"" is one where demand increases as the price increases. That's the opposite of what economics tells us is supposed to happen. But while this seems crazy, most people are familiar with this concept based on how they buy wine. Most people aren't going to buy a $3 bottle of wine. If you change the price to $10, a lot more people will buy it. As the price moves higher, people view the product as being more and more desirable. Part of the appeal of a high - end Ferrari is the very fact that it costs $1 million (for example). So ,  by creating a product that commands super-high pricing and which people want in part because it is super-expensive, Ferrari is one of the rare companies that has created and maintained a Giffen  good. Ferrari is able to  generate such high returns on capital because they generate luxury-good-type profit margins, not the low profit margins of an automaker, and because they generate so much revenue per car, they generate high asset turnover as well. The Ferrari thesis is pretty straight forward. We think it is near-impossible for any other company to create the sort of ultra - exclusive club that Ferrari manage s . The competitive moat around their business is essentially impenetrable. We simply think that they will continue to generate outstanding returns on capital with steady growth on existing models, and we think they will ramp up their unit sales in the years ahead to create significant growth. The company only sells about 9,000 cars a year globally,  which, if you assume their target market is people with over $10 million in wealth, means they have only penetrated about 0.5% of their potential market. Limiting sales is one of the most critical aspects of managing their business. But we think they can increase production, and that because they only run their factory at about 35% capacity, incremental production will have gross profit margins of 70% to 80%, leading to a large increase in profit margins and earnings power. Rotonti : Over the past three  years, from 2016 through 2018, Mastercard's  constant currency organic revenue grew at a 15% compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR ),  and EPS achieved a whopping 28% CAGR. According to S&P Global, over those three years, Mastercard generated an average ROIC of about 40%. And over the next three years, 2019 through 2021, Mastercard expects a constant-currency organic revenue CAGR in the ""low teens"" and EPS growth in the ""high teens."" This financial profile is next-level amazing. But does it justify Mastercard's stock selling at a next-12-month P/E of nearly 30? Stannard-Stockton : Yes. Mastercard's financial profile truly is ""next-level amazing."" But a P/E ratio isn't justified because a company is ""amazing."" The value of a business is nothing more than the present value of the cash flow that it will distribute to shareholders in the future. And future cash flows are related to the rate of growth a company can achieve and the amount of cash the company needs to reinvest (i . e., not distribute  to shareholders) in order to achieve that growth. The amount of cash needed to fuel growth is directly related to the return on invested capital a company achieves, which is why we focus so much on this metric. In the case of Mastercard, the company has minimal need to reinvest in their business to fuel growth. They only spend about 2% o f earnings on growth capex and have negative working capital excluding cash, meaning that they actually generate  cash as they grow rather than needing to reinvest it. They also don't need to invest much into their income statement. For instance, the amount they spend on advertising is essentially unchanged over the past 10 years, even as revenue has grown by 300%. The vast majority of  companies need to reinvest most of their cash flow and even obtain outside financing to grow at the rate Mastercard has grown over the last decade. But Mastercard has basically hemorrhaged  cash even as they've grown quickly. We think that, in general, investors overpay for high growth. But many investors don't full y  appreciate the value generation of businesses with high returns on invested capital. When you combine high returns on investment capital being applied against a large growth opportunity that is likely to persist for a very long time, the combination makes for a very valuable business expressed in a higher-than-average P/E ratio. Mastercard certainly doesn't have unlimited value, but we believe it continues to be worth a good deal more than the current market price. Rotonti : Broadridge Financial Solutions  is a company I cover at The Motley Fool, and it's currently one of my highest-conviction ideas, with the stock trading for about  $105 , down from its 52-week high of $138. Broadridge reaches  80% of North American households, yet I would guess that a good portion of those households ha ve  never heard of the company. Can you tell our readers what Broadridge does and please explain your investment thesis? Stannard-Stockton :  Broadridge is the most important financial-services company that you've never heard of. They process the settlement of stock and bond trades, manage proxy voting for 98% of listed companies, mutual funds and ETFs, and provide statement delivery and other investor communications on white-labeled businesses. If you invest in stocks and bonds, Broadridge is involved in multiple aspects of your account despite you never seeing their name. Broadridge is a good example of one of the types of businesses that we regularly find attractive. They provide a mission-critical service to their customers (which include s  almost all of  the top Wall Street firms), and yet the cost of their services is  immaterial to their customers '  financial  results . For instance, if a large brokerage company decided to switch from Broadridge to a cheaper competitor for statement delivery, the cost savings would be so small that no one would notice. But if during the switch some client statements were produced incorrectly or not sent, the broker would have customers and regulators all over them. One of the worries that crops up from time to time among investors is whether a new SEC regulation will hurt Broadridge. But in their long history, they have never experience d long-lasting, material negative impacts from regulation. While the company does operate under SEC regulations, we think they are better understood as a private-sector partner to regulatory bodies. Broadridge's services help Wall Street firms meet regulatory requirements, rather than Broadridge's services themselves being the focus of regulators. Rotonti : I'm torn on Netflix , and it's fair to say that it's a company I've been very wrong on every step of the way (that's not the case with my colleague Jim Mueller and Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner, who have been very bullish for a very long time) . I think the company has reached escape velocity, and that it will be very difficult for the competition to catch up. But  Netflix currently generates negative free cash flow (FCF), and according to S&P Global, it trades at a next-12-month P/E of about 87. What is your investment thesis on Netflix, and how do you think about its optically high valuation? Stannard-Stockton : If you think about a traditional business that requires a lot of capex in order to grow, the growth investment does not run through the income statement, it runs through the cash-flow statement. This results in solid earnings per share, although free cash flow might be near zero. This sort of business, where the stock price is supported by curren t earnings and investors cheer the reinvestment of earnings as long as  return on invested capital is solid, isn't the sort of thing that needs to be defended. But in Netflix's case, one of the key ways they are investing in growth is by maintaining an artificially suppressed price for their service. Netflix won the most Oscars and most Emmys of any content producer. And they have a simply massive library of content for every taste. Yet even at the newly raised price of $12/month, Netflix costs less than HBO, which is just one channel. It costs much, much less than any cable TV package. In fact, it costs about the same as a single movie ticket. With this huge gap between the price being charged and the value being received, both on an absolute basis as well as in comparison to other quality content providers, we think Netflix has tremendous pricing power. While we don't think they could add $5 to the price overnight without losing customers, they've been steadily raising the price for years at a rate in the high single digits with their most recent price increase the largest yet. While they do lose some customers from the sticker shock of higher prices, it seems most of those people who quit end up missing the service and come back again later, because there has simply been no material slowdown to their net subscriber growth. If you apply a $15-$20 price to their current subscriber count, all that incremental pricing falls to the bottom line, and the P/E ratio would plummet to about 17. Selling content on a global basis is a hyper-lucrative business. We think Netflix is making the smart strategic move to minimize pricing as they race to become the dominant provider of quality video content to the whole world. It is possible that  other players can catch up now that they've finally realized that Netflix has turned the tables on them and left them far behind. But John Malone, known as the Cable Cowboy for helping build the cable industry and having the best investment record of anyone in the media space, has said that ""it's way too late"" for anyone to catch Netflix. When a company is spending capex to grow, it is reported directly in the financial statements. But in underpricing their product, Netflix is engaging in an approach where it is not clear how much they are really ""spending""  on growth . Is the true market-clearing price the current $12? Or $15 to $20 as we think? Or might it be much higher? Why isn't Netflix worth $25 a month? That's still half the price that many people pay for basic cable. We can't know for sure just how much Netflix can command for their monthly service. But we're confident that it is more than the current rate, and we're very aware of how the economics of the business flip from ""cash-flow-burning"" to ""spewing out buckets of cash to shareholders"" as the monthly price moves higher. Rotonti : I feel like First American Financial , a company in which my colleague Philip Durrell has high conviction, flies under the radar  b ut deserves more attention. According to S&P Global, its returns on equity (ROE) have increased in each of the past five years and it has an attractive 3% dividend yield. What does First American do, and what is the source of its moat? Stannard-Stockton : First American is one of the two dominant providers of title insurance. When you buy a house,  you want to be sure that the person selling it to you actually owns  it and no one else has placed a lien against the house (such as an unpaid contractor). Assuming you use a mortgage to purchase the house, the lender will require that you obtain title insurance. First American and Fidelity National have an effective national duopoly on this industry. Under American law, the title of a house is not recorded in a centralized government database. Instead, title records are held in a wide variety of local databases, with disputes settled in the legal system. First American and Fidelity National have built what are referred to as ""t itle p lants, ""  or detailed records of title history. This allows them to validate and revalidate title histories. Unlike, say, stocks and bonds, which are standardized records, housing records stretch back a hundred years or more, without many standard record systems and with things like property boundary lines found in scanned, hand-drawn maps . This makes these types of records particularly difficult to attempt to standardize [in order to] automate the title underwriting process. First American earns lower returns on invested capital than most of the companies in our portfolio. But on the other hand, there is next to no disruption risk, and we think people will [continue to] be buying and selling homes and requiring the services of a trusted third party to validate the legitimacy of what is almost certainly the largest purchase the buyer will make in their life.  While some people have raised the risk that blockchain technology may represent to title insurers, to date this seems to be mostly a theoretical risk, and First American themselves appear to be leading the experimentation with blockchain technology in their industry. We like First American in particular right  now because while home prices have broadly recovered, the number of home sales occurring each year is still well below what we believe the normalized rate will be. A big reason home prices have increased so much is because the amount of inventory on the market is constrained. New homes continue to be built at a very low rate, and a number of  factors are conspiring to keep homes off the market. But the nature of markets is that they rebalance over time. We expect that over the medium to long term, the number of home sales will increase significantly and First American will earn a fee associated with each of those transactions. Rotonti : Landstar is a fairly low-margin business with five-year (2014-2018) average free-cash-flow ( FCF )  margins of 5%  (note that I'm calculating FCF as operating cash flow less  capital expenditures) . But according to S&P Global, the company has net cash of $56 million, and over the past five years it generated average ROIC of 22% . Overall, its business economics look quite exceptional. How is Landstar able to generate such high returns on invested capital? Stannard-Stockton : Profit margins are only half of the equation that drives return on invested capital; the other thing is asset turnover, or ""asset turns."" Most everyone is familiar with profit margins, but asset turns are a little less well understood . Let's say that you are a retail store and you buy $90 million of inventory that you sell for $100 million, and on average it takes you one year to sell the items. Excluding all other costs ( like rent and salaries, as well as taxes), the retailer invested $90 million and earned a $10 million profit for a 11% ROIC. But what if the retailer was able to sell all that inventory in just three month s , went out and bought another shipment of the same products, and thus was able to ""turn"" their inventory four times in a year. Now their $90 million investment has earned them $40 million for a 44% ROIC. Now that's a super-attractive business. So ,  while Landstar has low margins, they have high asset turnover,  and this creates a high level of ROIC. Their high turnover comes from the fact that they don't actually own  a lot of assets. Unlike a trucking company that owns trucks, Landstar is a logistics company that provides a service to shippers and truckers. By being an asset-light business, they can turn modest profit margins into great ROIC. Most of the businesses we own have pretty high  profit margins. High margins mean you are adding a lot of value on top of the raw costs of creating your product or service, and this suggests you're making something truly valuable and differentiated. So ,  one important thing to do with Landstar is to calculate the net revenue (or gross profit) they generate and look at profit margins on this basis. Eighty-five percent of the cost of shipping a load via Landstar goes to the trucker and/or agent who moved the load. Fifteen percent goes to Landstar. That's what they earn for providing logistics. They currently earn about 50% profit margins on this net revenue and 70% incremental margins on each new dollar of revenue. So, while the company is producing about 7% reported operating margins, this is better understood as 0% margins on the pass-through costs of transportation and 50% profit margins on their logistics service. Y ou can see that they are both providing a tremendously value - added service and generating fantastic ROIC. Rotonti : What sort of long-term growth profile does Landstar have? At what rate (roughly speaking) do you think Landstar can grow revenue and EPS over the next five years? Stannard-Stockton :  Revenue for Landstar is primarily a function of how many truck loads they move and the average price per load. These metrics are both cyclical. So  while any given year can see wide volatility, over a five-year period we would expect load growth across the country to be  about 2% per year, with Landstar growing loads by around 4% a year as they continue to take share. Now that pricing, after many years of being well below trend, has come roaring back; we think from these levels, you probably only get about inflation-type increases. So that adds together to about 6% revenue growth per year. I mentioned earlier that incremental profit margins on a net revenue basis are about 70%, versus the 50% level they reported in 2018. Therefore, over the next five years, we would expect profit margins on a net revenue basis to expand to about 55%. This would lead to operating income growth of about 9%. Landstar has a history of doing opportunistic buybacks with their heavy excess cash flow. We would expect share count to decline by about 2% per year, leading to about 11% EPS growth over the next five years. Rotonti : A significant portion of Starbucks's future growth is expected to come from China. On the one hand, the market opportunity there is large and growing. I've seen estimates for the size of the Chinese middle class ranging from about  300 million to 400 million  people . Statista estimates the number of middle class in China will reach 700 million  by 2020. A recen t report from Diamond Hill says that China plans to move 250 million  people from rural areas to urban cities by 2026 . And Starbucks has been building its stores and scale in China for 20 years . According to Starbucks, its new stores in China generate the highest  ROIC across the company, and Starbucks is opening more than one new store every day across China. That all seems very positive. But on the other hand, China is not traditionally a coffee-drinking culture, and its per capita consumption  is only five to six cups per year, compared with more than 300 cups in the U.S., according to Sanford C. Bernstein (via The Wall Street Journal ). There is also currently much higher demand for coffee delivery in China than in the U.S., and Starbucks is facing intense competition from Luckin  Coffee (a venture-backed startup) and McDonald's on the delivery front.  Are you comfortable with Starbucks's competitive position in China  and its ability to increase prices as it has in the U.S.,  and are you confident in the long-term profitable growth opportunity that China represents for Starbucks? Stannard-Stockton :  There is no doubt that China is an emergent economy  with consumer preferences and competition in flux. But w e think Luckin  is wrongly characterized as a material threat to Starbucks. Luckin  was founded by a former executive of a ride-sharing company, and we think they are more of an on-demand  consumer company that is using coffee as their initial core product.  Hopefully, their efforts to make coffee a ubiquitous beverage option in China -- and the fact that they are highly subsidizing the price to help lure non-coffee drinkers into trying coffee -- will increase the total address able  market of Chinese coffee drinkers for Starbucks. For readers interested in learning more about Luckin  and the degree to which their efforts are competitive, or not, with Starbucks, I would strongly recommend this TechBuzz China podcast  on the topic. Certainly ,  if the coffee opportunity in China is as big as it appears, there will be multiple winners. Starbucks is a dominant force in the U.S. coffee market, but even here, McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, and so-called ""third wave"" coffee shops such as Blue Bottle  own significant parts of the market. We believe strongly that Starbucks 's  coffee offering is differentiated  and [that the company] will continue to grow market share in China as the size of the total address able  market also grows. Rotonti : In a sort of related question, Starbucks built its brand as the ""third place"" where people can spend their time away from home or work and enjoy a daily delight. But it seems as though some of its new growth initiatives, including drive-through stores, delivery, and a virtual store in China, are moving the company at least partially in a new direction. This is probably inevitable given the growth of the digital economy/e-commerce, but do you think this changes the Starbucks story in either a positive or negative way? Stannard-Stockton :  Good question. With every investment, it is important to understand what exactly the company's actual value proposition is. For Luckin , for instance, it is fast, cheap coffee available on demand at kiosks all over the place. Starbucks has a relatively nuanced, multifaceted value proposition, and it is important to understand what that is and whose needs it meets. For me personally, I count on Starbucks to provide me my expected dose of the drug caffeine at a reasonable price and in a comfortable location that I can find almost anywhere I go. The fact that the company is also able to meet my potential desire for a relatively healthy fast-food option at the same time makes their value proposition even stronger for me. The ""t hird place""  element of the value proposition, the idea that they provide a comfortable, public space in which I can meet someone, pause during my day for a break, or catch up on work while I'm traveling, is a great bonus. But for me personally ,  the third-place  element is not core to the company's value proposition. On the other hand, Arif, one of the analysts on our team, primary goes to coffee houses because he wants to sit down for awhile and enjoy a special treat (a handcrafted espresso drink). For him, third-wave coffee houses offer a better value proposition, and while he might stop in to a Starbucks, the third-place  element of their stores is inferior to higher-end third-wave coffee concepts. That being said, Arif  would agree that Starbucks's ubiquitous presence makes it a great solution for him to grab a cup of coffee or stop in with his family for a healthy fast-food and beverage experience that he, his wife, and their kids all appreciate. Todd, another analyst here who lives outside Cincinnati, has highlighted for us the importance of drive-through options in the Midwest and South. Outside of metro areas, and  in particular  in  areas with weather extremes, drive-throughs solve a lot of customer problems. Starbucks has noted the same thing, and has highlighted on recent calls that stores that feature a drive-through window in the Midwestern  and Southern parts of the U.S. generate about 20% higher sales per store. So ,  while Starbucks popularized the third-place  concept as a core part of their value proposition, we think that today it makes up one part of a multifaceted value proposition. In China, at this moment in time when the country is only beginning to see the rise of the café culture that has been available in the U.S. and Europe for many decades, we think the third-place  element of Starbucks is particularly important. It is no accident that the company recently opened one of the largest Starbucks in the world in Shanghai. The 30,000-square-foot store is one of the company's high-end Roastery concepts, offering sit-down meals, alcohol, and a range of ultra - premium coffee drinks not available in their traditional stores. So ,  while the company has smartly  partnered with Alibaba to provide a much stronger delivery option in China to meet consumer needs, it is also important that they stay focused on the third-place element of their value proposition and not get pulled into competing head-to-head with Luckin  on the efficiency/deliver y /low-cost value proposition. Rotonti : In December 2018, Starbucks lowered its long-term guidance for the second time in about a one-year span. Starbucks now expects global comps growth of 3% to 4%, revenue growth of 7% to 9%, and non-GAAP EPS growth of at least 10%. Are these reasonable expectations? Stannard-Stockton :  Yes, we think they are. Realize that the company should be able to drive 2% comps from inflation-based  price increases alone. So adding 1% to 2% to comps from increasing the volume of purchases can be achieved by getting people to come to Starbucks more frequently (especially in the slower afternoon time slot), increasing the sale of food, and, especially in China, increasing the amount of customers per store, which we think will happen naturally once they stop growing their store count so aggressively. Rotonti : Howard Schultz i s one of the all-time great business builders and CEOs, and he's beloved and admired by so many (including myself). I think he really showcased that creating a great workplace culture (that provides full health care, stock ownership, and opportunities for development) and sustainable sourcing of coffee can supercharge growth and ROICs. But politics can be polarizing. Are you concerned that if Schultz decides to run for president, particularly as an independent, that it could reduce traffic to Starbucks stores and pressure U.S. same-store sales (or comps)? Stannard-Stockton : You know, it ' s funny, but when we first invested in the company ,  it was being criticized by President Trump, and we had some concern that politically conservative clients of ours may object to owning the company. Now the tables have  turned, and with Schultz considering running as an independent  and  thus  potentially siphoning votes away from the Democrats' candidate , we have had a few politically liberal clients voice their concerns . While Schultz' s  campaign is certainly a bit of a wild card, we don't expect him to play a material role in the next election and so don't expect his activities to impact the company's results. If we're wrong and he does play a central role in the election, we still don't really think it will have a long - term impact on the company's  financial results.

But that being said, we  are well aware that there is a risk to companies when they or their major shareholders and/or executives engage publicly in politics. But we think it is relatively rare for these political activities to have a lasting impact on the company. For instance, our portfolio company Nike was in the political news last year after they made Colin Kaepernick the face of their anniversary ad campaign. But while that caused the stock to bounce around for a couple weeks, it hasn't actually had  a major, lasting effect on the company's results. Rotonti : Is there anything else that you'd like us to know about Ensemble Capital? Stannard-Stockton :  Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me, John. At Ensemble, our core focus is on identifying and investing in competitively advantaged companies. Some of these may be considered ""growth stocks,"" while others might be labeled ""value stocks."" But to our way of thinking ,  we don't care what labels they get; we just want to find companies that have strong and durable competitive moats, have management teams that understand value generation and capital allocation, and which we think we as a research team have the capacity to understand and make reasonably accurate forecasts about their future.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about what we do.

1576," The Fed's latest meeting on March 19-20 was a dovish one and indicated that it didn't see a likelihood for any hikes through 2019 . However, that also indicated that they would be closely monitoring the economic data, most of which are expected to improve over the year. Futures markets are currently pricing in no chance of a hike and in fact there was a 55% probability that the Fed might cut rates. However, the minutes do not hint at rate cuts. The meeting summary noted that ""some participants indicated that if the economy evolved as they currently expected, with economic growth above its longer-run trend rate, they would likely judge it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly later this year."" But even in this situation, rates rate is likely to remain subdued in the near term. Investors should note that, in March, federal funds rate projections for 2019 were trimmed to 2.4% from 2.9% while the same for 2020 and 2021 was cut to 2.6% from 3.1%. For the longer term, the rate is projected at 2.8%, unchanged from the December forecast. The accommodative Fed should do good for stocks as there will be a few more months of cheap money inflows. Among stocks, income-producing securities might do even better for investors in search of solid and steady current income. The past decade was especially favorable for dividend ETFs as central banks including the Fed has been ultra-dovish (read: 6 Dividend ETFs That Beat S&P 500 in the 10-Year Bull Run ).

1578," Maintenance and cleaning products manufacturer WD-40 (NASDAQ: WDFC) perhaps could have used some water-displacing lubricant on a rather creaky top line this quarter. Company revenue in the fiscal second quarter was flat against the prior-year period at $101.3 million, due mostly to a dip in U.S. sales. The company improved net income by 7% to roughly $16 million this quarter. Nonetheless, shares fell 5% in the trading session subsequent to the earnings release. Below, let's zero in on three comments made by CEO Gary Ridge during Tuesday's earnings conference call that bring perspective to the last three months of operations as well as the quarters ahead. Net sales in WD-40's Americas segment (comprised of the U.S., Canada, and Latin America) dropped by 2% to $43.9 million in the second quarter. Of the two factors behind this decline mentioned above, variable product rotation in warehouse shopping clubs is fairly routine. Investors typically understand that retail shopping clubs frequently change the manner in which they feature manufacturers' products, leading to lumpy sales from one period to the next. The delayed promotions issue is perhaps more worrisome. As I discussed last quarter , WD-40 has selectively instituted price increases to offset rising materials costs. Over the last three months, a major retail customer in the U.S. balked at the sticker hikes, and essentially delayed running a planned promotion on WD-40's products to demonstrate its displeasure with the pricing it was forced to pass on to its customers. According to Ridge, the conflict has been resolved, after data-informed conversations in which WD-40 demonstrated non-price related benefits that the retailer's customers are realizing from the manufacturer's products. Despite the reassurances that both factors are one-off pressures on the current quarter -- and not representative of trends -- the news of slight disruptions in the company's largest revenue segment undoubtedly contributed to the post-results selling in ""WDFC"" shares this week. Shareholders will scrutinize revenue in the Americas next quarter, in case a second data point indeed signals the beginning of a trend.  Image source: Getty Images. Departing from most other companies, which define ""EMEA"" as the geographical regions of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, WD-40 adds the nascent market of India to its EMEA business segment.  Image source: WD-40. In the second quarter, EMEA sales rose 3% to $40.9 million, contributing nearly as much to overall revenue as the Americas. As Ridge explains, EMEA's top line actually increased 10% to $43.5 million in constant currency terms. EMEA sales are benefiting from same phenomenon that has characterized sales in North America for so many years -- extensions of the company's core WD-40 all-purpose lubricant product tend to steadily capture market share. Ridge attributed the higher EMEA sales primarily to increased uptake of the WD-40 ""EZ-Reach Flexible Straw"" product. Digital marketing of products including ""1001 Carpet Fresh"" in the U.K. also contributed to the sales advance. Ridge noted that the EMEA market should provide a growth opportunity for the foreseeable future. Management estimates that it can sustain annual sales growth of 8%-10% in this market, which is well in excess of the low-to-mid-single digit growth WD-40 typically averages across all segments. WD-40 has an ambitious plan to push annual revenue from just north of $400 million today to over $750 million by 2025. The company intends to reach this milestone by focusing on five strategic initiatives, briefly summarized as follows: This fifth strategic initiative encompasses numerous smaller objectives, including incremental product improvement. As I alluded to above, extending use cases or embedding core products with adaptive features is a hallmark of WD-40's sustained success. Ridge revealed on the earnings call that in 2020, the company will roll out an improved version of its ""Smart Straw"" WD-40 can, the ubiquitous can found in hardware stores with an attached red plastic straw. The new version of the Smart Straw includes a lockable toolbox design to prevent accidental discharge, the ability to flip between spray and stream settings, and an improved ergonomic actuator that makes spraying easier, among other features. While such innovation around a simple spray can may seem mundane, the next-generation Smart Straw is a fine example of the type of product modification WD-40 regularly introduces around its core offering. As the organization awaits patent approvals for the Smart Straw dispenser innovations, management is confident that modest but effective enhancements like this will help WD-40 attain its ambitious goal of nearly doubling revenue over a six-year period.  10 stocks we like better than WD-40

1580," Amazon 's (NASDAQ: AMZN) dream of a cashless society where digital ones and zeroes take care of messy transactions is a great vision for the future. But right now, cash is still legal tender for all goods and services. To emphasize that point, some cities and states have recently gone so far as to explicitly make it illegal for a retailer not to accept cash as payment. That presents a challenge for Amazon, a digitally native retailer that's increasingly pushing into brick-and-mortar stores. Its Amazon Go stores are not only cashless, they're also cashier -less. But as more state and municipal legislatures propose bills that could make Amazon Go's business practices illegal, the company is working on ways to accept cash in its stores. Ultimately, being able to accept customers without bank cards is in Amazon's best interest. It's already developed programs to increase its online customer base among the 6.5% of U.S. households that are unbanked or underbanked, so it knows those customers present a real opportunity.  Image source: Amazon. Amazon's initial foray into supporting cash-only customers was the launch of Amazon Cash about two years ago. Amazon Cash allows consumers to go to a nearby retailer, scan a code linked to their Amazon accounts on their phones, and exchange cash for funds loaded into those accounts. The service is more secure than buying a gift card in-store to use yourself, since funds are loaded directly to your account. Amazon Cash is technically a solution to accepting cash payments in Amazon Go stores. But there are fundamental problems with the product that are preventing wider adoption. Customers are concerned about privacy, and their inability to retrieve those funds for use on things Amazon doesn't sell (like housing). There's also the additional hurdle of having to set up an Amazon account. Amazon has tried incentivizing customers to sign up with one-time promotions, and giving them additional funds when they load a certain amount into their accounts. But the efforts haven't produced very good results. As a result, Amazon Cash adoption has been disappointing. There's also the problem that not every person has a smartphone, which is necessary to use Amazon Cash. About 19% of U.S. adults don't own a smartphone, according to a Pew survey from last spring. It's likely that percentage is even higher among the unbanked and underbanked. Amazon can't really say it accepts cash at Amazon Go, if it only accepts cash from people who also have a smartphone. An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC this week that the process for paying in cash at Amazon Go stores , when implemented, will be pretty simple -- ""you'll check out, pay with cash, and then get your change."" But Amazon Go stores don't have registers or cashiers. You scan a code on the Amazon app as you come in, cameras follow you around the store tracking everything you take off the shelves, and then you walk out. Cash customers might not have a code to scan on their phone. Cameras can follow them around, but they won't be linked to an account. And they can't ""just walk out,"" as Amazon says, because they need to give cash to someone. Amazon might be able to create an analog system that mimics some of the digital systems in place. Even so, it will require additional expenses, including potentially reprogramming or adding additional programming to the machine-vision system for tracking customers throughout the stores, and establishing a means to accept cash. Most importantly, it might require stores to staff another employee to take cash payments, or to monitor a self-checkout system and troubleshoot. One of the keys to Amazon's strategy for Amazon Go is keeping its marginal costs low, increasing potential profit at scale. Adding more workers, who need to be paid hourly wages (unlike computers and cameras), would hurt those potential profits. Additionally, accepting cash and developing systems to do so opens the door a bit wider for potential fraud and theft, something Amazon's camera technology and secure online login have done a pretty good job of preventing. If Amazon must accept cash payments, it will find a way. It needs a more robust solution than Amazon Cash, but that makes things much more complicated for Amazon (even if it makes things simpler for customers). Investors should watch how this affects the company's expansion plans for Amazon Go, and what any potential solution could mean for store profitability.

1581," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips They say where there's risk there is reward. But in today's market, one stock where the odds favor big upside relative to one's exposure is mobile-game stock Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA ).  With investing in a gaming company like Zynga stock - which has had its share of ups over the years, there's always going to be the bear argument and loose associations with long-defunct gaming-trailblazer Atari. And those doubting Thomases, to a certain extent, raise some valid points. For example,  Zynga stock's mostly stagnant daily average user numbers the past few years are one concern. And competition from free-to-play gaming sensation Fortnite and established heavyweights like EA (NASDAQ: EA ) and Activision (NASDAQ: ATVI ) successfully engaging the mobile-first gaming market do appear to raise the specter of failure for ZNGA. But the bears are wrong to be so pessimistic. Internal and external challenges aside, ZNGA is not in a 'game over' situation like Atari. In fact, while there are risks, that's nothing new. What is new is Zynga's successful pivot from a browser and PC-based model into a much more defensible mobile-first platform. And it's been a game changer. Zynga's transition has boosted sales growth, earnings and even allowed the company's operating cash flow to jump by more than 240% over the past year. Nice, right? But that's not all either. According to InvestorPlace's Wayne Duggan, this strategic move has made Zynga stock the fastest-growing player in the mobile-first market with an annual bookings run-rate of $1 billion. Now and with multiple new game launches tied to wildly-popular Hollywood vehicles Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and Star Wars and ""bold beats"" updates to popular Zynga franchises; in our estimation it's a  'game on' scenario for ZNGA off the price chart.   On the price chart, Zynga stock also looks to be in a strong 'game on' position. The weekly view in Zynga stock shows a company that's been already been very nice to its investors in 2019. But that's not exactly unique, is it? All one has to do is consider the major average's own double-digit gains to better appreciate the situation. Still and unlike the market, I believe Zynga is going higher from here. What sets Zynga stock apart at this juncture is ZNGA's bullish run just started a couple years ago. Following a near-crippling technical correction shares have re-emerged into a fairly solid-looking uptrend. With ZNGA having consolidated laterally the past few weeks to digest its year-to-date gains and its 5-year highs just above current prices, conditions are ripe for a successful breakout. It's anticipated a challenge of the immediate resistance will fall swiftly to the wayside and an even larger rally in 2019 is in store for Zynga stock. For investors agreeable with our optimism for ZNGA off and on the price chart, shares are in position for purchase today. Realistically, this position has 5% to maybe 10% technical exposure before I'd pull the plug on any adverse moves from today's price of $5.50. Regarding an upside target, I won't bore you with Fibonacci levels or  other potential hazards. Rather, I'd simply suggest peeling off some risk at $7.00 as that would allow for a realistic upside target that jibes nicely with the initial exposure and playing the game smartly.

1582," Shares of some of the biggest names in the semiconductor industry, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD , Nvidia NVDA , and Micron MU have surged in 2019. The climb is due in part because Wall Street and investors began to see value in some chip names after many tumbled, along with other tech giants, to end 2018. With that said, the historically cyclical semiconductor industry appears to be in the midst of a downturn. Companies in the industry are beholden to their customers' product cycles, capital investments, and more. On top of that, chip oversupply can hurt pricing power, as is currently the case for some firms in the industry. Still, despite the current woes, the industry looks poised to remain highly valuable within the larger technological revolution. Semiconductor companies are poised to help drive forward the growth of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and much more. And it won't just be the likes of Tesla TSLA , Apple AAPL , Microsoft MSFT , Google GOOGL , and Amazon AMZN that are set to turn big profits and see their stocks climb as these industries expand. Therefore, a return to growth is likely on the horizon for the industry as a whole, even if some face rough near-term outlooks. So, let's take a look at three Zacks buy-ranked semiconductor stocks right now. 1. KLA-Tencor Corporation KLAC KLA-Tencor is part of the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry and is one of the largest semiconductor equipment companies in the world. The firm provides advanced process control solutions for manufacturing wafers and reticles, along with integrated circuits and packaging. Shares of KLAC have soared roughly 40% since the start of the year, hitting new highs along the way. The firm, which recently received Intel's INTC 2018 Preferred Quality Supplier award, currently pays a $0.75 per share dividend and has a yield of 2.54%. KLA-Tencor is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now based on its positive earnings estimate revision activity. Looking ahead, the company is expected to see its current adjusted full-year EPS figure pop 5.4% on the back of 11.9% revenue growth. Peeking further down the road, KLAC's earnings are projected to jump 11.3% above our current-year estimate in the following year on 17% revenue expansion. The company also rocks  a ""B"" grade for Value in our Style Scores system and is trading in line with its industry's average P/E at 14.63. 2. Cree, Inc. CREE Cree is a manufacturer of LEDs and semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company's ""SmartCast"" platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms. Cree rocks a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment and shares have soared 51% in 2019, to blow away the S&P 500 and the broader industry. The Durham, North Carolina-based company has a strong history o f quarterly earnings beats. This includes an avera ge earnings surprise of 52% in the trailing four periods. Plus, analysts expect Cree's current fiscal year earnings, which ends in June, to skyrocket 310%. Better yet, this growth is expected to continue to the tune of another 63% in the following year. The company also sports an ""A"" Grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. 3. Xilinx, Inc. XLNX Xilinx's Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform is situated to help support the expansion of everything from AI and machine vision to databases and data compression. The company's stock price has soared 55% in 2019 to help XLNX hit new highs along the way. Meanwhile, Xilinx's position in the Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry, which currently ranks #2 out of the 256 industries in our Zacks system, could help XLNX's climb continue. Xilinx posted record Q3 revenue and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 a share. Looking ahead, the company is projected to see its fiscal Q4 revenues surge roughly 23% from the year-ago quarter, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. At the bottom end of the income statement, Xilinx's adjusted Q4 earnings are expected to soar 48.5%. Xilinx is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter financial results on April 24. Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple-Digit Profit Potential

1584," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pinterest is once again in the in IPO (aka, initial public offering) market. A couple weeks ago, it pulled its IPO and went silent. Now it's back, with a new filing. At this point, it's setting its price at $15-$17 for 75 million shares. That's about a $10.6 billion total valuation. But in 2017, it had a financing round of $12.3 billion, so even its most optimistic stock pricing ($17 a share) would have it fall under that price. Somehow, the stock has lost $2 billion in value from 2017 to 2019. Now, it may well happen that the IPO soars and doesn't touch $17 again. It may also happen that Pinterest and its bankers figure it's better to be conservative with the valuation rather than fully price it and set itself up for disappointment in its early trading days or when it has to report earnings. But there's no doubt that the new wave of tech IPOs is starting to look like it did back when the dotcom boom hit. Lyft (NASDAQ:
LYFT
) just went public. Uber is soon to follow. Zoom Video Communications is about to IPO, as are biotechs Hookipa Pharma and Turning Point Therapeutics , as well as insurer Palomar Holdings . The real question is, as these firms enter the ""real world"" of public trading, how will they get along with the other players already out there. The reason people are comparing Pinterest to Twitter (NYSE:
TWTR
) is that they kind of take up a similar space, but also both have about the same amount of monthly active users (MAU), the major benchmark for social media companies. Basically, MAUs are a measure of how many people use the site at least once a month. There is also a daily active user metric, but MAU represents a better view of an app's entire user base. DAU volume varies but MAU is more consistent. When comparing Pinterest with TWTR, also remember that Pinterest is working very hard at expanding its MAUs as well as its revenue base right now. More is better - for investors and the Street. TWTR, on the other hand, is an established company and currently is purging its app of all the bots and various other kinds of cybertrash that has accumulated over the years. That means its growth is slowing, but as a more mature company, we're getting a better picture of its real revenue, user base and profitability. This is an important difference. The market forces will change at some point for all companies - in young companies, the Street wants subscriber growth, and in more mature companies, it wants solid, expanding revenue streams. That's not to say that Pinterest isn't making money. Last year the company said ad revenue was approaching $1 billion. But the thing to remember is that TWTR works across platforms, so it can work with all the big social media apps. Pinterest can't; it will be on its own for now, which could be a good thing or a bad thing. My Portfolio Grader has TWTR as a B-rated stock right now.

1586," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips When it comes to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), the bull thesis can be summed up in one sentence: Amazon has a built a huge and unparalleled global e-commerce ecosystem, which it is now leveraging to build multiple, valuable tangential-business verticals. Furthermore, the sum of these verticals will power robust revenue and profit growth longer-term and drive Amazon stock meaningfully higher.  The core idea here isn't hard to understand. Amazon is only scratching the surface of how much it can monetize each one of its 100 million U.S. Prime members. Right now, that includes revenue from Prime and Amazon.com sales. However, management has several expansive options at its disposal. For example, Amazon can throw digital ads at those 100 million members. They can also sell them pharmaceutical goods, as well as create for them a logistics system. Later, management can outsource that system much like they did with Amazon Web Services. Plus, they can create a parallel offline business, sell more private-label brands, and create better streaming music and video services. In other words, Amazon's future opportunity to monetize its dedicated Prime membership base is enormous. Management realizes this, and they are doing everything possible to scale these opportunities. Some of them won't pan out. Some of them will. The ones that do work will ultimately add billions of dollars of profits to Amazon's bottom line. They will also serve as the fuel for the next leg higher in Amazon stock. The most exciting of these new verticals? Digital ads. Considering Amazon's wide reach and robust, unique consumer-data set, I reasonably think Amazon's digital-ad business has the potential to double the company's profits by 2025. If so, that massive growth will inevitably drive Amazon stock significantly higher. Amazon is one of the most visited websites in the world. Depending on whom you ask, Amazon.com ranks anywhere from tenth to fifteenth place internationally. Excluding adult or China-based websites, Amazon.com is right behind Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ), YouTube , Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Instagram . Yet, relative to those highly visited web peers, Amazon has a tiny digital-ad business. The Google advertising ecosystem, including YouTube revenues, is projected to measure north of $100 billion in revenue this year. Analysts expect Facebook's advertising umbrella, including Instagram revenues, to measure around $70 billion in revenue this year. Meanwhile, Amazon's digital-ad sales will likely hit just $14 billion in 2019. That's relatively miniscule. Further, of the global digital-ad pie, industry experts forecast Amazon's market share to reach merely 4% this year.  This will change dramatically over time. Amazon is just now getting serious about its digital-ad business. They have the reach (a popular website) and data (consumer-behavior profiles) to grow share quickly in this market. This is already happening. The Wall Street Journal reported that ad dollars are flowing in bulk from Google to Amazon, while eMarketer says that Amazon's share in the U.S. digital-ad market will rise from around 4% in 2018, to approximately 7% by 2020. Overall, then, Amazon has a clear trajectory to dramatically grow share in the secular growth global digital ad market over the next several years. In the big picture, growth in the digital-ad business is important for Amazon stock because it will lead to a profit surge that will allow the stock to head meaningfully higher. Based on steady, mid-single digit growth rates, the global media-advertisement market should grow to $1 trillion by 2025. Digital ad penetration should rise closer toward 65% by then, implying a $650 billion digital-ad market. It's reasonable to assume Amazon takes home about 10% of this segment. That would give Amazon $65 billion in digital-ad revenue by 2025. Facebook operates around 40% operating margins. Applying those same margins to Amazon, that would give Amazon's digital-ad business $26 billion operating-profit potential by 2025. Taking out 20% for taxes and dividing by 500 million shares, that equates to north of $40 in earnings per share. That's a substantial number for this company. Amazon is projected to do less than $30 in EPS this year. Thus, assuming the e-commerce and cloud businesses fall completely flat over the next several years, this company should still be able to do about $70 in EPS by fiscal 2025. In reality, both those businesses will keep growing, and there will be additional catalysts from pharma, logistics, and offline retail. All in all, then, $100-plus in EPS by fiscal 2025 is very,  very doable. I actually think that number will pan out closer to $150. If so, Amazon stock won't need a nosebleed multiple to justify a big price tag. Based on a growth average of 20x forward earnings, $150 in EPS by fiscal 2025 will support a $3,000 price tag for Amazon stock. The story at Amazon continues to play out in favor of the bulls. The company is aggressively expanding into higher margin businesses. These expansion efforts are fueling continued top-line growth, while simultaneously expanding margins. Profits are consequently roaring higher. This is allowing the multiple to compress, while still powering gains in the stock. In other words, Amazon stock is the quintessence of growing into a big valuation. Consequently, this stock remains a long-term buy-and-hold. The ""growing into"" phase is just starting.

Fastenal also notes that its gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, in the first quarter of 2019 was down 100 basis points to 47.70%.

It also comes in above Wall Street's losses per share estimate of 2 cents for the period, but wasn't saving RAD stock from dropping today. Net loss reported in the Rite Aid earnings release for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2019 comes in at $272.98 million.

1589," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stocks blasting to new highs usually come bearing gifts - for bulls, at least. If you're a bear, then beware because these super-powered leaders pack a punch. And that makes them some of the best stocks to buy. I ran a quick scan last night for new yearly highs. With Wednesday's rally, dozens of stock made the list, giving me ample choices from which to identify who deserved a coveted spot in today's gallery. The infatuation with stocks that are blazing into virgin territory, or at least new yearly highs, is well founded. Shareholders are basking in profits. There is no overhead supply, no group of afflicted owners begging to get back to breakeven. Short sellers are losing money - more than ever before. And that creates some serious incentive to cover their positions. More demand + less supply = bullish. Check out these three stocks to buy at new highs.   Were it not for Cisco's (NASDAQ:
CSCO
) inclusion in the list, the title would have been ""3 Stocks to Buy at Record Highs."" But during the height of the dot-com bubble, CSCO stock rallied as high as $82 before its crash to single digits. And that means this week's jump to $55.82 only represents a fresh 19-year high. It's still impressive. The strength of this year's uptrend has been matched by its consistency. The 20-day moving average has proven the perfect companion by supporting every pullback. Recent profit-taking formed a high base pattern that potentially triggered with yesterday's rip. Given this year's history of profitable breakouts, I see no reason to bet against another upside thrust. Consider buying the June $55 calls for $2.65.   Since breaking out of last year's trading range, Paypal (NASDAQ:
PYPL
) has been on a tear. With yesterday's bump, its year-to-date gains now stand at 28%. The last upswing saw increasing momentum, and all major moving averages are rising beneath the price. Volume patterns are also backing the bulls. I see a handful of accumulation days over the past quarter, with only a few sporadic episodes of distribution. The next earnings report looms on April 24, so consider that the wild card. But if you believe the trend continues, then buy the June $105/$110 bull call spread for $2.70. You could come close to doubling your money if PYPL stock rises above $110 by June expiration.   The price action of VMware (NYSE:
VMW
) has largely mirrored PYPL, at least recently. Its trend is booming, with the moving averages stacked atop each other in bullish form. Distribution has disappeared, with hardly any significant selling pressure.  Implied volatility is even tanking, showing uncertainty is running low these days. Pattern-wise, we've seen VMW stock develop a mini ascending triangle formation that it finally completed with Wednesday's surge. If this breakout follows the script of its predecessors, big gains await. I suspect we will see a push toward $200. To capitalize, buy the July $190/$200 bull call spread for $4.60. The liquidity of VMW options is mediocre, so limit orders are a must here. As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

1590," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Shares of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:
XOM
) are finally hitting some resistance after a major move higher. XOM stock is finally stalling out as it approaches some serious resistance levels. Now that oil is looking overbought as well, I expect a period of consolidation or pullback in Exxon Mobil stock over the near term Looking at the Exxon's chart, I'm seeing XOM scrapping the top of its range. XOM is fast approaching major resistance at the $84 area. This has proven to be a formidable level in the past. MACD is poised to generate a fresh new sell signal on any further weakness. Click to Enlarge Momentum has remained positive for the longest stretch over the past year but is tepid at best. Exxon is trading well above the 20-day moving average of $81.15, which has also been a bearish indicator. XOM stock finally ran into some selling pressure yesterday after an extended rally. Shares failed to make fresh new highs yesterday, opening lower and closing near the lows of the day. This type of price action many times signals a short term top in the stock. The buyers may finally be exhausted and the sellers have gained control. Exxon is the largest oil company in the U.S., so it makes sense that the stock price is highly correlated to the price of crude oil. Recently XOM stock has begun to dramatically outperform the price of oil, as seen in the chart. Click to Enlarge I expect Exxon stock to revert back toward the traditional relationship to crude. This means XOM should be a relative underperformer over the next few months. Considering my less than-bullish-outlook for oil prices in the intermediate term, I think Exxon Mobil stock will languish at best and likely pullback. Traders should look to short XOM stock on any rallies for the foreseeable future. Options traders may want to use the resistance level at $84 to structure bear call spreads. The June $85/$87.50 call spread can be sold for a 50 cents net credit. Maximum gain is $50 per spread with maximum risk of $200 per spread. Return on risk is 25%. The short $85 strike price provides a 3.75% upside cushion to the $81.93 closing price of XOM. Exxon Mobil stock will go ex-dividend by 82 cents in May. Anyone short the shares on ex-date is liable for that dividend. Earnings are due May 3. Tim Biggam may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

) comes from JPMorgan analyst Christina Brathwaite. This has Brathwaite changing her price target for the stock to $12. The previous price target for WTW stock from this analyst was $14. A price target drop is obviously bad Weight Watchers news. However, it's also important to note that the price target of $12 is also below the stock's current price. WTW stock was sitting at $20.54 when markets closed on Wednesday. This has the new price target sitting at roughly 42% below that price . The Weight Watchers news also has the JPMorgan analyst holding to their current rating for the stock. This has Brathwaite leaving WTW with an ""Underweight"" rating. Brathwaite is incredibly bearish when it comes to WTW and her target price is the lowest among analysts, reports MarketWatch . Brathwaite recent altering of her price target for WTW stock has to do with recent Weight Watchers news. This includes that the company may see a 40% drop in daily average subscribers for the first quarter of 2019 when compared to the same time last year. Another reason for the lower price target is the possibility that the company will have to make a prepayment on a loan.

1592," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Thirty years ago, Tim Berners-Lee changed the world forever. At CERN - the world's largest physics lab - he came up with the vision for the World Wide Web, which he set out in a paper entitled ""Information Management: A Proposal."" While his innovation took some time to take hold, it would eventually lead to the Internet Revolution in the second half of the 1990s. From this would emerge iconic companies like eBay (NASDAQ:
EBAY
), Yahoo! and Alphabet (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
, NASDAQ:
GOOG
). But of course, not everything was rosy. During the past few years, we've seen how the internet can lead to bullying, invasions of privacy and yes, even outside election influence. Because of this, the UK is planning on passing landmark legalization to help curb some of these adverse effects . At the core of this is to impose a duty of care on internet companies to their users. In other words, there could be more liability and restrictions, which could hamper growth. What's happening in the UK will probably not be a one-off. The country's efforts could serve as a model for many others . So what does this all mean for internet stocks? Well, there is no need to panic. Laws take time to evolve. Besides, when it comes to investing, the new regulations may wind up actually helping larger internet companies. After all, they have the resources to deal with the requirements. Next, enterprise internet companies should also be relatively unscathed. These companies are focused on internal purposes and generally have a strong focus on security and privacy. So in light of all this, what are some of the interesting internet stocks to watch? Let's take a look at seven:   True, Facebook (NASDAQ:
FB
) is the poster child of what's wrong with the internet! But this is fine. It means that the company has little choice but to find ways to deal with the new world of the internet - and is likely to keep thriving as an internet stock. For example, last year the company ramped up its headcount for its safety and security division, from 10,000 to 30,000. But another key has been Facebook's major investments in AI. Keep in mind that the company runs about 300,000 machine learning models every month. But all this is not much of a burden, as the company keeps generating substantial free cash flows. Note that they came to $15 billion in 2018. In all, there is $56 billion in Facebook bank. It is also important to note that FB remains the dominant Internet company, in terms of users. The base is currently at 2.7 billion. What's more, there should be continued robust growth as properties like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger are still in the nascent phases of monetization.   Of course, GOOGL has more than enough resources to invest in its security and safety systems as well as to fend off litigation. In the latest quarter, free cash flows came to a hefty $5.9 billion. The total in the bank? About $109 billion. Even with its enormous scale, GOOG is still growing at a strong pace. Last year revenues jumped by 23% to $136.8 billion. A big advantage for the company is its wide assortment of digital properties. The search engine, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, Android and Play all have over 1 billion users. As far as internet stocks go, GOOGL is one of the most diversified. But GOOGL also continues to invest in next-generation technologies. For example, its Waymo self-driving car business is poised to disrupt the massive auto industry. Consider that - in Arizona - the division is already providing an automated tax service.   The past five years has seen a transformation of Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
), going from an on-premise provider of software to a cloud-based focus. The first part of this strategy has been the retooling of the existing franchises like Office. Note that the cloud version, Office 365, has more than 155 million active users . Next, there has been the development of new products, such as Teams and OneDrive. Although, Azure is perhaps the most important. This is the core cloud hosting platform that is focused on taking on the leader in the market, Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) AWS system. While MSFT has much work to do, the company has certainly made considerable progress. Azure's market share is 15% compared to AMZN's 35%. And finally, MSFT has leveraged its resources to engage in aggressive M&A. And so far, the deals have been spot-on. The LinkedIn acquisition means that this internet stock now controls the largest professional online network, which has roughly 610 million members . Then there is the recent deal for GitHub, the leading sharing network for programmers. The platform has over 31 million developer accounts. In terms of the cloud opportunity, it is still large enough to allow for long-term growth for MSFT. According to Gartner , spending is forecasted to go from $175.8 billion in 2018 to $278.3 billion by 2021.   Adobe (NASDAQ:
ADBE
), which was founded in 1982, has seen dynamic changes in the past few years. One of them has been the transition to the cloud, which has resulted in a powerful recurring revenue base. But ADBE has also ramped up its dealmaking, as the company has acquired companies like Magento and Marketo. The result is that there is a diverse set of revenue streams, all of which are growing at a nice rate: Granted, the latest quarter was a disappointment. But this should be nothing to worry about. For the most part, the company is in the process of digesting its acquisitions. However, when looking at the long haul, there should be more than enough room to grow. Keep in mind that the addressable market opportunity is in excess of $100 billion .   With the tax season in the final stretch, the folks at Intuit (NASDAQ:
INTU
) are definitely busy. The company's TurboTax is seemingly invisible leader in the online tax prep business. And it is a significant contributor of ongoing high-margin revenues. But of course, this is not the only franchise for INTU. The company also dominates the lucrative small business accounting market with its QuickBooks system. It has seen renewed growth as INTU has migrated to the cloud. While all this is great, there is something else that these two businesses provide: rich data. In other words, this can be turned into other growth businesses. For example, INTU has recently entered the market for lending to small businesses and it has already shown much traction. About 60% of the customers that get approved for loans are considered ""un-lendable"" by traditional financial institutions yet the loss rates are less than half the industry standard.   Talend (NASDAQ:
TLND
) does not get much attention. But it should. The company is benefiting from the megatrend of data integration for cloud computing. It's a tough problem to solve but TLND's technology has been tested for some time. Note that the roots go back to a highly successful open source project. As for growth, it continues to be strong. In the latest quarter, revenues shot up by 38%. The customer based also went over 3,000. It's true that the data market may not be sexy - but it is strategic. And as seen with companies like Mongodb (NASDAQ:
MDB
) - which is another open source player - the returns for shareholders can be standout.   As an executive at Salesforce.com (NYSE:
CRM
) in the company's early days, executive Tien Tzuo had first-hand experience on the difficulties of creating a home-grown subscription platform. So he wondered: Might there be an opportunity here for a startup? Well, there was. Tzuo would go on to co-found Zuora (NYSE:
ZUO
), which is the leading player in the enterprise-level subscription market. During the latest quarter, customer usage came to $10.8 billion, up 56% on a year-over-year basis. No doubt, this has translated into strong performance on the top line, with revenues up 40% for last year to $235.2 million. Some of the latest customers include Briggs & Stratton, Kia Motors, Ricoh and Bloomberg. But ZUO is really still in the early phases of the opportunity. According to a report from Canaccord: ""Zuora will sustain revenue growth above the Mendoza line for software companies, which nowadays is about 30% for the next 3-5 years.""

The MSCI U.S. Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index, a widely followed gauge of domestic real estate equities, is up over 16% year-to-date. Indeed, real estate ETFs are clearly benefiting from the extension of this bull market , but there is more good news. Investors considering real estate ETFs are benefiting from increased choices. Gone are the days when the only funds on the market were broad funds focusing on large-cap, traditional real estate investment trusts (REITs). These days, investors have a broader array of real estate ETFs to consider, allowing them to get tactical while accessing some prominent themes and still generating compelling levels of income. Here are some of the best real estate ETFs to consider right now.  Expense Ratio: 0.6% per year, or $60 on a $10,000 investment. The Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate SCTR ETF (NYSEARCA:
SRVR
) is a prime example of a real estate ETF built for the sector's changing investment opportunities. SRVR's member firms are at the epicenter of seismic shifts in demands for data storage facilities due to booms in 5G , cloud computing and other technology-driven themes. ""The five publicly traded data center REITs have rebounded mightily thus far in 2019, though. As of April 2, according to Nareit, the year-to-date return for data center REITs totaled 22.5 percent, less than only one other REIT sector - industrial (22.8 percent),"" according to National Real Estate Investor. SRVR is a right place, right time real estate ETF because many of its traditional rivals lack adequate exposure to data storage REITs. The difference in results between having and not having that exposure are palpable. SRVR is beating the aforementioned MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index by 600 basis points this year.  Expense Ratio: 0.6% Keeping with the theme of nuanced real estate ETFs that are trouncing their standard rivals, there is the Pacer Benchmark Industrial Real Estate SCTR ETF (NYSEARCA:
INDS
). While its stablemate SRVR is dedicated to REITs with exposure to transformative technology themes , INDS is at the forefront of retail disruption. Industrial real estate properties can have many uses, but one of the primary drivers of INDS's success is the demand for warehouse space being created by surging online retail sales. Those demands are boosting occupancy rates, allowing some industrial REIT operators to have pricing power. Those factors and others explain why INDS is beating the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 Index, which is light on industrial REIT ETFs, by about 300 basis points this year. ""We anticipate that industrial REITs will wait out the short-term trade turbulence, but the long-term outlook for the sector remains sunny. Industrial real estate performed well in the last decade-catalyzed by the rise of e-commerce and increased demand for omnichannel and last-mile delivery,"" according to Commercial Property Executive .   Expense Ratio: 0.35% When the typical real estate ETF yield will not do, investors thirsty for higher levels of income can consider the Invesco KBW Premium Yield Equity REIT ETF (NASDAQ:
KBWY
). KBWY, which holds 29 real estate stocks and tracks the KBW Nasdaq Premium Yield Equity REIT Index , has a 12-month distribution rate of just over 7%. In addition to that high income stream, KBWY is attractive for another reason: this fund can be used as a complement to traditional real estate ETFs, which are often large-cap heavy. The average market value of KBWY's components is $2.4 billion, putting this fund barely in mid-cap territory. Nearly two-thirds of KBWY's holdings are classified as value stocks, giving investors a real estate avenue for a rebound in the value factor.  Expense Ratio: 0.53% Having recently celebrated its first anniversary, the U.S. Diversified Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:
PPTY
<) is one of the newer funds in the category and is another alternative to traditional real estate ETFs. ""PPTY is a rules-based fund that uses stable geographic and property type targets to provide diversified exposure to U.S. real estate,"" according to the issuer . ""Our portfolio is constructed based on the actual properties held by each company in our investment universe. This focus on the underlying real estate allows PPTY to deliver consistent exposure and reliable diversification."" About 51% of PPTY's holdings are residential, office and industrial REITs. With location being a primary point in this fund's REIT selection criteria, it is not surprising to see many of the higher-end U.S. real estate markets among the fund's top 10 geographic exposures. For example, New York; Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; and San Francisco combine for 34.2% of PPTY's geographic weight. All of PPTY's top 10 geographic exposures are U.S. cities.   Expense Ratio: 0.45% The Hoya Capital Housing ETF (NYSEARCA:
HOMZ
) debuted last month, but could be an interesting option for investors looking to capitalize on trends in residential real estate, including housing shortages. HOMZ targets the Hoya Capital Housing 100 Index, which is a rules-based index ""designed to track the companies with the potential to benefit from rising rents, appreciating home values, and a persistent housing shortage,"" according to Hoya Capital . Like some of the other real estate ETFs mentioned here, HOMZ is an alternative to traditional funds in this category. In addition to large weights to home furnishing and retail companies, HOMZ has above-average exposure to real estate technology companies, among other groups that are rarely represented in standard real estate ETFs.   Expense Ratio: 0.6% The NetLease Corporate Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:
NETL
) is another new addition to the real estate ETF fray, having also debuted last month. As its name implies, NETL focuses on a strategy known as the net lease. Under the net lease structure, ""the tenant pays taxes, maintenance and insurance in addition to the monthly rent. This reduces the REITs' exposure to rising operating expenses and helps make cash flows more predictable,"" according to Nareit . There are some tax benefits to that structure, as well as the potential for steady cash flow dependability, which serves as the backbone of rising dividends among REITs. Over 32% of NETL's holdings are industrial and retail REITs. At the geographic level, this fund has some prime locations among fast-growing, low-tax states, as highlighted by a combined weight of 14.7% to Texas and Florida.   Expense Ratio: 0.70% The IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:
ROOF
) is a dedicated small-cap real estate ETF and lives up to that billing, as its 73 holdings had an average market value of $1.6 billion at the end of last year . Owing to the defensive nature of real estate stocks, ROOF probably will not outperform traditional small-cap funds over long holding periods, but this real estate ETF is up an admirable 15% year-to-date. Plus, ROOF yields 6.5% - about five times the yield on the Russell 2000 Index. ROOF allocates 39% of its combined weight to specialized and diversified REITs and another 34% to retail and office REITs.

1594," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Even with the benefit of a gain of more than 8% in April, the performance of Sony  (NYSE:
SNE
) stock has been disappointing. So far in 2019, Sony stock is lower by 4% and over the past year, Sony stock is down 5%.  Compare that to the MSCI Japan Index and the S&P 500, which are up 9% and 16.10%, respectively year-to-date. Sony, the maker of the PlayStation video-game console, has recently been taking its lumps. In the video-game space, SNE faces intense competition from established competitors, such as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:
MSFT
), as well as some well-heeled new entrants . Additionally, some sell-side analysts are not impressed with Sony's efforts to shed its lagging businesses. ""Sony's inability to exit the Smartphone business resulting in continued losses, a peak of game profits and increasing uncertainty imply pedestrian profit growth over the next two years,"" said Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal in a note to investors last month , in which the analyst downgraded Sony stock to ""hold"" from ""buy."" The analyst forecast tepid profit growth across some of Sony's other marquee businesses. ""Goyal estimates profits in Sony's insurance, television, and imaging businesses will each either decline or flat-line during its fiscal 2019,"" reported Barron's . ""In addition, he predicts the profits of Sony's gaming business will fall 5% annually over the next two years due to hardware price cuts and falling software sales,"" the publication noted.  As noted earlier, Sony stock roared higher earlier this month amid speculation that Daniel Loeb's Third Point hedge fund is building a stake in SNE stock. The hedge fund previously held a position in Sony stock and urged SNE to spin off its movie business to create value for shareholders.  But SNE ignored that advice, and Third Point liquidated its position in Sony stock in late 2014. ""Third Point's amassed stake in Sony thus far could not be learned,"" according to Reuters . ""The hedge fund, which has about $14.5 billion in assets under management, is raising a dedicated investment vehicle, targeting between $500 million and $1 billion in capital, so it can buy more Sony shares, "" the news service added, citing unnamed sources. It appears that Third Point will once again push SNE to sell its movie business in order to boost Sony stock. Again citing unidentified sources, Reuters reported that Third Point believes  Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:
NFLX
) have expressed interest in buying Sony's movie business. Sony's movie business is estimated to have generated revenue of $2.85 billion in the first three quarters of 2018. The U.S.-listed version of Sony stock has a market capitalization of $58.4 billion as of Apr. 11, indicating the movie unit is a small, but still valuable, part of the overall value of Sony stock. The bottom line for long-term investors who are considering buying SNE stock is that more than supposed interest from an activist investor is needed to further boost SNE. Markets are efficient and, as highlighted by the Apr. 8 pop of SNE stock, the Third Point rumor is now baked into the valuation of SNE stock. Based strictly on its price-earnings ratio, Sony stock is cheap. The shares trade at just 12 times analysts'  consensus estimate for fiscal 2020. Plus, SNE has $8 billion of cash, representing a pretty significant chunk of its market value. Even with the recent downbeat tone on SNE stock sounded by some analysts, the average analyst price target on Sony stock is north of $64, representing significant upside from the stock's level of $46 in late-morning trading on Apr. 11. An addendum to the bottom line of Sony stock is that investors who buy SNE in the near-term are likely making bets that the company will shed its movie or smartphone businesses or both. But there are simply no guarantees that SNE will carry out either transaction. As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

1595," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Already up over 35% year-to-date, Netflix (NASDAQ:
NFLX
) has a high chance of continuing its strong performance for the rest of the year. Even after raising its revolver commitments to $750 million .  Investors justify the high valuation for Netflix stock by pointing to streaming giant's market share growths. And why not? The price paid for the stock is not a worry when the underlying company is still in its growth phase.  Netflix amended its credit terms to increase its commitments to $750 million, up from $500 million. It also extended the maturity date to March 29, 2024. The extra two years will give the firm more flexibility in managing its debt obligations. Given the company's thirst for acquiring content to grow its library, investors are welcoming the revisions. The terms are that aggregate debt does not exceed $3.75 billion - up from $2.5 billion - and 2.75x consolidated EBITDA - up from 2.5x. Back when Netflix was in the midst of pivoting from DVD rentals to online streaming some years back, it could not raise monthly rates. At the time, pricing was sensitive to demand elasticity. These days, customers are enjoying fresh, original content so much that they are unlikely to cancel their subscription when prices go up. On February 26 , Piper Jaffray speculated that Netflix could raise prices internationally. By adding $1.00 to the monthly rate, Netflix could grow its revenue significantly - almost instantly. Conservative investors may want to avoid assuming that a price hike in international markets is possible. In India, the $8 a month is already above that of cable service. Plus, India is among the top five countries for peer-driven piracy . I think in India, the best-case scenario for Netflix is that the higher rate will only offset the drop in subscribers. Although this happened a while ago, Netflix's price hike in Nov 2018 in Canada suggests that customers in developed countries will absorb the higher rates and will not cancel their service. Investors need to look at the company's most recent fourth-quarter report to validate that view. For the U.S. market, Netflix will impose a higher pricing plan on new members, while existing members will face higher prices over several months. Financially, the company will rake in the benefits gradually through the course of the year. This is still a positive development for investors because ASP (average selling price) will improve over the course of 2019. As Netflix puts that added revenue to good use, better content and unique features like interactive shows will accelerate revenue growth and operating margin sequentially.  CEO Reed Hastings provided some color on the price hike strategy. He said that subscribers want incredible content and better product experience. To get that level of service, the company must ask for a bit more money so that it may invest in the product. Investing in original film also changes the company's economics. Netflix has to pay for content upfront, which requires more cash flow. But so far, the payback is higher. Bird Box is an example of a title validating the new economics of the business. The company is so detailed in the way it targets its customers that it tailors the content to the geography. And in Korea, Japan, and India, tastes are more geographically specific, so Netflix needs to stream more unique shows in these regions. So I think, in the long run, raising prices to reinvest in content will pay off. 32 analysts covering Netflix have a $402.68 price target on the stock, according to Tipranks . Investors will have to decide if the implied 11.8% in upside is worth chasing at this time. Cautious investors may select a number of number-crunching models to arrive at a downside target. These models assume that EBITDA multiples are too high. It also sets company value, with revenue, discounted back to present value, is not high enough to justify the current share price. Subscription growth and new content will keep investors interested in NFLX stock. With higher ASP on the way, fundamentals are starting to back Netflix's valuation, even though that is of secondary importance.

1596," InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The new year brought about the revival of the tech sector trade, especial the chip stocks. As a result, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:
AMD
) is up big, and there is more left in it.  It is important to note that Advanced Micro Devices stock was already outperforming most stocks. It's up almost 180% in 12 months which is more 12 times the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:
QQQ
) and 20 times the S&P 500 , so the trend continues. Consensus on Wall Street is that under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, AMD set itself up for great success in the new world of technology. Our lives now depend on it more than ever. The global trend is to incorporate more tech into every aspect of our daily lives. All financial transactions will be electronic soon, and we now are tethered to our smart phones 24/7 to stay plugged in. This is creating more demand for products and services from tech companies, so AMD will have that strong demand to boost its sales for decades to come. As long as they continue to execute this well, they are poised to thrive for years. In January, I wrote that AMD stock would continue to rally even in the face of uncertainty. It did so all of last year when investor sentiment was awful. So the stock has the trust of buyers with strong conviction and this is likely to continue. This is rare, as the current overall rhetoric is sheepish as the S&P 500 hovers near all-time highs. Moreover, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:
XLK
) set a new high this week, yet AMD is still 18% below its September high mark. And therein lies the opportunity. If this market-wide rally continues then AMD is poised to set its own records so there is at least that much of upside potential in the next few months. If I am long the stock, I stay in it. Momentum traders can buy it here to capture that incremental upside. There are no guarantees we get there, but as long as there are no new macroeconomic shoes to drop, the buyers are currently in control of the stock markets. Fundamentally, the stock is not cheap. AMD is twice more expensive than Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) and four times more than Intel (NASDAQ:
INTC
). But as they say, you get what you pay for since it also out clobbered both of their 12 months performances. While AMD is up 180%, INTC is only up 9% and NVDA is down -16% for the same period.  When it comes to the chip sector, their popularity goes in waves. It all comes down to positioning, and AMD has the investor confidence that they did it right. This will likely continue until management makes a mistake. Currently there are no hints of that happening, as the CEO seems she has a solid vision and the right team around her to help her execute it. So until that changes, there is no reason to believe that the stock will falter. Furthermore, we still have the geopolitical risk, especially from the tariff war. While the front with China is coming to a happy close, President Donald Trump hinted at the start of another tariff war with Europe next. Perhaps this is why the rhetoric is fraught with negativity. The danger is that it could turn into fulfilling prophecy and create a mini correction. Luckily, the central banks are still committed to global growth. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the ECB recently recommitted themselves to keeping rates low, so the macroeconomic conditions still favors the bullish thesis. Also there is the uncertainty that the BREXIT saga brings, and that is unfolding too slowly. Nevertheless, I can remain long AMD stock as long as it stays above its recent support zones. There are two - the first at $27 per share short term and the second at $24.50. Simply stated, if the stock markets are higher in a few years then so is AMD stock.
